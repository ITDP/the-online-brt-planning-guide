2.0.0: future first release: manu is already online, let's not keep it in eternal alpha state
 - parser: improved messages for parsing errors and unclosed/unexpected tokens
 - syntax: introduce a restricted vertical mode for box, list and table contents: headings and other boxes not allowed
 - syntax: remove all vertical markdown syntax: `>@` for quotations, `#` for headings and `#FIG#` for figures
 - syntax: remove deprecated syntax: `\boxstart`
 - ui: improved handling for unexpected char errors: print the highlighted context as well
 - tex: separate generated tex assets by size: this allows asset compression before the LuaLaTeX run
 - lexer: new TEscaped token to differentiate between regular and escaped text
 - html: generate DParagraph(Math) as display math
 - tex: generate `\manu<size>figure` and `\manu<size>imgtable` calls instead of fixed and inlined TeX code
 - tex: generate tex figures and img-tables with correct sizes (partial)
 - syntax: add `\url` for URL literals
 - syntax: add `\title` for non sectioning titles (think: titles for paragraphs)
 - other small fixes and improvements

1.0.0-alpha: development of a stable system

 - many more fixes, improvements and additions
