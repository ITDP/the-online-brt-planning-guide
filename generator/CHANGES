2.0.0: future first release: manu is already online, let's not keep it in eternal alpha state
 - parser: improved messages for parsing errors and unclosed/unexpected tokens
 - syntax: introduce a restricted vertical mode for box, list and table contents: headings and other boxes not allowed
 - syntax: remove all vertical markdown syntax: `>@` for quotations, `#` for headings and `#FIG#` for figures
 - syntax: remove deprecated syntax: `\boxstart`
 - ui: improved handling for unexpected char errors: print the highlighted context as well
 - tex: separate generated tex assets by size: this allows asset compression before the LuaLaTeX run
 - lexer: new TEscaped token to differentiate between regular and escaped text
 - html: generate DParagraph(Math) as display math
 - tex: generate `\manu<size>figure` and `\manu<size>imgtable` calls instead of fixed and inlined TeX code
 - tex: generate tex figures and img-tables with correct sizes (partial)
 - syntax: add `\url` for URL literals
 - syntax: add `\title` for non sectioning titles (think: titles for paragraphs)
 - ui: added `DRAFT_NO_MATH_VALIDATION` and `DRAFT_DINOSSAUR_FIGURES` configuration environment variables: both are implied from `DRAFT`
 - ui: added `TEX_NO_POSITIONS` configuration environment variables
 - other small fixes and improvements
 - html: generate cleaner urls (#119)
 - syntax: add `\html\store` for storing assets manually
 - syntax: add `\html\head` for writing to the <head>
 - syntax: ~deprecate~ remove `\html\apply`
 - syntax: forbid unescaped backslashes in paths and other raw arguments

1.0.0-alpha: development of a stable system
 - syntax: change math markers to `$$`; `\$` is still allowed, but is mostly unnecessary
 - other: better error messages throughout
 - ui: add color and underscore highlight modes for error context
 - optimization: add an asset server for sharing across builds, branches and pull requests
 - many more fixes, improvements and additions
