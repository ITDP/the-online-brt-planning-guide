\chapter{Infrastructure Management and Costing}

The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the infrastructure design process required
to deliver a BRT corridor and its associated infrastructure components. The chapter first describes the
infrastructure components that make up a BRT system, and then describes the infrastructure design process.
Finally, the chapter deals with the calculation of design and construction costs for the various infrastructure
elements using an infrastructure cost calculator. The cost of maintaining the infrastructure can be assessed
by means of an infrastructure maintenance cost calculator (as detailed in Section 21.4.2), whereby life-cycle
costing of infrastructure elements or materials can be evaluated.
