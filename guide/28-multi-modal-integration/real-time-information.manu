\quotation{I feel more comfortable in a place like Brighton - a town, with one centre, one bus station, one train station. And there are so many arty, creative people, and things are less rushed, less stressed.}{Gabrielle Aplin,  English utube-singer-songwriter,  1992 --}


Advances in technology are helping to make information integration easier and making traveling through 
the city easier. Having static information about how to connect to other modes at a station helps customers 
finish their trip. Even just mapping the existing services can be revolutionary in terms of helping customers 
know how to make and plan for trips. Having digital information available to the customer, where it be 
through Google maps using data standards like GTFS, or through apps like Where Is My Transport, helps 
customers plan and make better decisions about how to reach their destinations.

mobile routing applications and designed a new (and first) transit map for the city.}{The Digital
