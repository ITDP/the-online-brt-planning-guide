Intermodal facilities are the result of transport planners purposely linking the operational characteristics 
of one mode to another. This enables customers to transfer between BRT services and to access services 
of other modes. It is the compatibility and the ‘interwoven’ matrix of scheduled services, communicated 
through integrated information systems, both static (such as timetables and maps), and dynamic (i.e., 
real-time information about approaching vehicles), and the use of an integrated ticket that helps determine 
the level of transfer and the success of an intermodal station. 

\subsection{Wayfinding}

Four principles of wayfinding for intermodal hubs:
\item \highlight{Easy and Intuitive.} Station should be designed so that customers 
can intuitively find their way and see their destination. Direct lines of movement and sight are key;
\item \highlight{Consistent, Clear and Legible.} Signage should be consistent, clear, and 
easily legible from a distance. Ingress and egress signs should be clearly differentiated;
\item \highlight{Extensive.} Information boards providing route information, station layouts, 
and local destinations should be located all around the station and the surrounding area. This allows 
people to orient themselves before they exit the station, and to know how to get to the station;
\item \highlight{Standardized.} The use of standard station layouts, signage, and information 
systems within a transport network significantly improves the wayfinding experience. 

\subsubsection{Internal Circulation}

Information germane to the multimodal terminal, station, or stop includes route identification (line 
number), directions to the various modes contained within the station (Metro, ferry, BRT, bike parking), 
intermodal possibilities within the station and along the transport route, and arrival and departure 
information. Much of this will be provided by each service provider; however, the smart systems will 
organize and coordinate the information.

\subsubsection{External Circulation}

Information about access to and from the station and the surrounding neighborhoods is integral to intermodal 
integration. This "last-leg" of a journey completes the system. Often this is a walking trip, so much 
of the information at this level is highly detailed. It is important to display this information as time-based 
(e.g., within a ten-minute walk) as people more intuitively understand time (as opposed to distance). 
Signage is not limited to the station proper; signs giving directions to stations should also be away 
from the station.
