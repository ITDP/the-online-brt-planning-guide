Methods of public participation range in type, and they reflect the specific characteristics of each
place. Thus, while the basic toolbox for participation is relatively similar everywhere, how these tools
are combined and how each tool is used can and should be adapted to local conditions and needs. Indeed,
they should evolve constantly along with local conditions and be limited “only by the creativity of their
practitioners” (Giering 2011, p. 2).

Participation: \url{http://www.iap2.org}.

When it comes to choosing between a bus-based system and rail, politicians and citizens alike tend
to prefer surface and underground rail systems. Thus, being careful to frame a new BRT with a name and
a set of associations relevant to the specific project and the lives of potential users is important.

BRT can learn from nonmotorized transport modes that have attracted powerful advocates in groups, movements,
and among key planners and politicians who have organized to push these modes onto policy agendas and
keep them there as banners for friendlier, more socially just, and sustainable cities. Enrique Peñalosa,
the former mayor of Bogotá, has played this role in the case of BRT, but even in his home city efforts
have flagged relative to other priorities in the face of recent political turnover and a lack of an engaged
civil society that could offer continued support through the mercurial nature of politics.

As a rule of thumb, large-scale efforts will reach more people, but will impress them less. Small-scale
efforts, especially ongoing work with a relatively small group of diverse but representative individuals,
require more work, but can produce deep change.
