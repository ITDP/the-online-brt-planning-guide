As with communications planning (see Chapter 9: Strategic Planning for Communications), it is important
to define what a successful public participation program will look like as you plan your outreach. There
are no consistent methods for defining success in a public participation process for BRT, although there
are both quantitative and qualitative methods available for evaluating public involvement. The threshold
that defines “success” is dependent on the complex mix of variables including the size, reach, and level
of controversy surrounding a given project, the resources available for a project from the organization,
the community in question, and the overall intent of the public participation effort.

Criteria for measurement are set by the goals and objectives of the project. While measuring things
like numbers of meetings and participants is relatively straightforward, outcomes are more complex to
quantify. The International Association for Public Participation offers guidelines for evaluating participatory
processes. Basic criteria regarding the process of participation includes whether:
\item The public had access to appropriate resources and clear information to allow them to meaningfully participate;
\item The purpose of the participation tasks were clearly defined;
\item The decision-making process was structured appropriately to allow for and incorporate public input;
\item Efforts were cost-effective;
\item Views were diverse and representative.

Measuring success of outcomes is trickier to quantify because of the diversity of preferred results.
For example, an agency might consider public support or ease of implementation as an appropriate outcome,
while the public might consider the extent to which the community can achieve its goals or block decisions
as better measures of success. Outcome-based success measures can include:
\item Project or decision acceptability;
\item Project efficiency;
\item Cost avoidance;
\item Mutual learning and respect;
\item Improved understanding;
\item The amount of conflict resolution required;
\item The degree of consensus achieved;
\item Influence on decision making;
\item Participant satisfaction with the results of the process.

Preestablished metrics, including performance indicators, benchmarks, and performance standards, set
beforehand and based on key project goals, can help gain up-front agreement on what to measure. These
metrics can also be integrated into the project plans. Regardless of the evaluation method used, it is
essential to keep evaluation in mind as part of public participation planning from the outset. While
some approaches will be more fruitful than others, clearly delineating expectations at the beginning
will help determine what needs to be changed as the project develops, and what you can do differently
in the future. Public participation, if managed properly, is a gold mine of information and a source
of knowledge that cannot be achieved in any other way.
