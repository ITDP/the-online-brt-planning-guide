Public participation strategies are as diverse as the communities, locations, and agencies they serve.
Specific public involvement techniques and the methods by which public transport providers execute public
involvement strategies are constantly evolving. There are, however, some overall generalizations about
the elements of agency public participation strategies and the process for creating them.

Although this chapter focuses primarily on agency-government-user/civil society interactions, the
principles of participation outlined here apply to other stakeholders including operators and drivers
(addressed more comprehensively in Chapter 16: Vehicle Operator Contracting and Industry Transition).

Governments, private sector, and civil society actors have diverse and sometimes contradictory views
of what citizen participation in urban transport planning should be. Maximizing success in participation
requires a fundamental shift from viewing public engagement and participation as an obligation to understanding
it as an opportunity to improve and build the short- and long-term viability of the system. A well-designed
participatory process can also strengthen the long-term credibility and viability of organizations that
build civil society.

\subsection{Goals and Objectives}

Just as in communications planning, goals and objectives play a key role in public involvement strategies.
They guide the entire process, influencing who will be engaged, the level of participation desired, the
type of information that will be needed, and the techniques to be used. Goals and objectives also set
expectations about what the public participation effort will achieve and provide a basis for measuring
outcomes.

The goals themselves should be based on the specific needs of the project. What are the questions that
need to be answered? What are the missing pieces of information? What type of public buy-in is desired?
Below are common project-specific goals from the International Association of Public Participation.
\item Inform: To provide the public with balanced objective information to assist them in understanding the problems, alternatives, opportunities, and/or solutions;
\item Consult: To obtain feedback on analysis of alternatives and/or decisions;
\item Involve: To work directly with the public throughout the process to ensure that public concerns and aspirations are consistently understood and considered;
\item Collaborate: To partner with the public in each aspect of the decision, including the development of alternatives and the identification of the preferred solution;
\item Empower: To place final decision making in the hands of the public (IAP2 2010). As with communications planning, each goal should be followed by specific, measurable objectives. For more information on defining goals and objectives, see Chapter 9: Strategic Planning for Communications.

\subsection{Principles of Participation}

An essential part of having a well-designed participatory process is setting clearly defined principles
that all participants agree to abide by, which are enforced by leaders or coordinators of participant
groups. The Community Development Society () suggests the following five principles of good practice
in community development:

\item Promote active and representative participation toward enabling all community members to meaningfully
influence the decisions that affect their lives.
\item Engage community members in learning about and understanding community issues, and the economic,
social, environmental, political, psychological, and other impacts associated with alternative courses
of action.
\item Incorporate the diverse interests and cultures of the community in the community development process;
and disengage from support of any effort that is likely to adversely affect the disadvantaged members
of a community.
\item Work actively to enhance the leadership capacity of community members, leaders, and groups within
the community (so that they may be ambassadors for BRT).
\item Be open to using the full range of action strategies to work toward the long-term sustainability
and well-being of the community.

There are many versions of these good practice principles, and they may be adjusted for local context
and to address specific concerns.

\subsection{The Passive vs. Active Approach}

In the past, agencies have offered suggestion boxes, toll-free telephone numbers, leaflets, or advertising
campaigns as examples of “participation.” While these offerings are not without value—high-quality collateral
and information is a precondition for participation—they do not constitute a participatory process.

Public transport providers must often make complex decisions about the type and amount of information
to provide to the public, balancing the risks of providing too little information and too much. This
can be further complicated by the often technical nature of the data and the risks of it being confusing
or misinterpreted. However, information sharing is important not just for meaningful public involvement,
but also for building trust within the community, creating transparency at the agency, enhancing advocacy
efforts, and proactively guiding the public conversation instead of allowing others (including the media
or other stakeholders) to dominate the debate.

Equally important for shaping the public involvement process is the agency’s determination of what
information it wants from the public. The survey results support the idea that for public transport providers,
public involvement provides the agency with critical missing information. When asked about the type of
input agencies typically want from the public, respondents noted that they want to know about community
issues that might impact public transport service, as well as chronic customer service problems.

Informational campaigns take place along a spectrum. At one end, you have one-way communication, which
means providing information, usually to a broad public with no ability to receive feedback from the audience.
This is what is known as a “passive approach.” Further along the spectrum are limited two-way communications
processes, such as feedback surveys or Internet voting on preferences, which tend to be more sophisticated
and have more of an impact on people’s thinking, although usually not on their behavior. At the other
end, you have a genuine participation process or an “active approach” that involves more complex two-way
or multi-directional communication, usually referred to as deliberation.

approach, where bidirectional communication, feedback and change foster optimum results.}{Courtesy of Carlos Felipe
Pardo and Lake Sagaris.}

Generally speaking, the more active the approach, the better the results. For example, in deliberation,
groups are engaged in an intense form of facilitated communication meant to bring crucial information
to the surface, including the participants’ knowledge, interests, feelings, and fears. In the urban sphere,
deliberation occurs in formal or informal spaces as preferred so people can hammer out agreements in
a more relaxed, trusting environment. It can involve being active in the spaces being planned by conducting
walking, cycling, or neighborhood access audits and reviews. This should happen in planning phases and
be facilitated by the BRT team in conjunction with community groups. A well-organized participation process
can transform people’s thinking and, more important, their actions.
