Depot facilities for an articulated bus can amount to more than US$40,000. The courtyard setting located in Poniente 152, in Mexico City, which serves the Metrob√∫s 3 line, came at a cost of approximately US$2.5 million. Fifty buses are stored within an area of 12,000 m2 with workshops, washing areas, and offices.

It is not always necessary to build bus depots, such as in the case of the Guangzhou, China, BRT where BRT routes are based on previously provided routes and use existing depot facilities, providing a more sustainable and economically attractive option.
