> The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.
@ Henry David Thoreau, author, 1817–62

The one variable that often has an overriding impact on vehicle selection is cost. The amortization 
of the vehicle is one of the principal operating costs that affects both operator profitability as well 
as the fare level. An exorbitantly high-cost vehicle will reduce system profits and make fares unaffordable. 
For this reason, attention to vehicle costing must be undertaken jointly with the operational costing 
model.

Some of the principal determinants of a vehicle’s cost are vehicle size (i.e., length) and the type 
of propulsion system. Other factors, such as interior design, engine size (including if it is a front 
or rear engine), type of chassis (including high or low floor), air conditioning, and number of doorways, 
will also play a role. For example, a low-floor vehicle will cost approximately 25 percent more than 
a higher-floor model.

Economies-of-scale in production is a major factor that affects pricing. For this reason, two 12-meter 
vehicles often cost less than a single 18-meter vehicle. This result occurs due to the significantly 
greater number of 12-meter vehicles produced in the world.

Because vehicle cost is not fixed, but a function of the scale of production, some cleaner, new technologies 
face initial high costs, which create a barrier to entry. However, cleaner vehicles also yield social 
benefits for beyond just public-transport customers. These factors may in some cases constitute a justification 
for short-term subsidization of cleaner bus technologies. 

Standard diesel vehicles are by far the least expensive vehicle technology. Most new BRT systems, such 
as the ones in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Guadalajara, Mexico, Istanbul, Guatemala City, 
are now using Euro V diesel technology. Clean diesel technology, in combination with good-quality fuel, 
can often meet or even exceed the emission standards of supposedly more sophisticated propulsion systems. 
In Johannesburg, the BRT system was used to introduce Euro V buses for the first time to the country.

After diesel, CNG is perhaps the next most common type of fuel used in road-based public transport 
today. In India, the capital cost of a CNG bus is about 20 percent higher than that of a diesel bus, 
and ongoing maintenance costs are about 10 percent higher. The fuel price is another factor that would 
also increase the cost of running CNG. A typical 900-millimeter, 12-meter AC diesel bus would cost somewhere 
between US$65,000 and US$85,000 in India. (Figure 20.45). Elsewhere, a CNG vehicle will increase the 
procurement price by between US$25,000 and US$50,000 US dollars. The cost difference varies widely, depending 
on how powerful the engine needs to be, which will be a function of vehicle size.

The electric trolleybus is also a fairly common propulsion type. Electric trolleybuses can be three 
times the cost of a comparable Euro II diesel vehicle. Further, the added infrastructure costs of the 
electric conduit and transformers can be significant. These extra costs are somewhat mitigated by the 
longer life of electric trolleybuses. Due to the lower mechanical demands on the electric trolleybus 
technology, the life of the vehicles can be twice that of diesel vehicles. Usually electric trolleybuses 
also have a backup diesel motor in case of a power failure, which accounts for part of the difference 
in cost. 

Quito utilized electric trolleybus technology on its first BRT corridor in 1996 (Figure 20.46). The 
technology was chosen primarily for its environmental benefits. Quito’s historical core is a World Heritage 
Site, and the municipality wished to reduce the impacts of diesel emissions on the integrity of the built 
environment. Further, Ecuador’s electricity generation is primarily from hydro-electric sources. The 
price of each vehicle was approximately US$700,000. In total, the added infrastructure for the electric-trolley 
corridor pushed capital costs to over US$5 million per kilometer. By comparison, a subsequent BRT corridor 
in Quito using Euro II diesel technology resulted in capital costs of approximately US$585,000 per kilometer.

of the associated infrastructure, resulted in a comparatively expensive system.}{Lloyd Wright}

Electric-diesel and electric-CNG hybrids are likely to be the next generation of clean vehicle technology. 
Currently electric-CNG and electric-diesel hybrids are available at US$100,000 to US$175,000 more than 
a standard diesel bus. The BRT systems in Cleveland, Ohio, and Eugene, Oregon, USA, both use electric-diesel 
hybrid articulated vehicles with a low floor. 

The BRT business plan outlined in the chapters in Volume IV will determine how much money can reasonably 
be spent on the vehicle procurement without compromising the financial viability of the entire BRT system. 
The business plan will indicate the maximum cost of the vehicle procurement (depreciation) and the maximum 
ongoing operating cost (including maintenance) that can be sustained, and how much the system will have 
to charge per vehicle-kilometer in order to cover these costs. The technical specification can require 
high levels of environmental protection, high noise standards, high aesthetic standards, and high levels 
of customer comfort, but only within the parameters that the business plan has determined to be financially 
viable. In some cases, the system being designed will be profitable, as in the case of TransMilenio Phases 
1-3, giving the system designers considerable freedom to set a high technical standard. In other cases, 
such as in very poor countries, customer demand may be highly sensitive to even modest increases in fare 
prices, placing tight constraints on the options for the technical specification.

Many local conditions will influence the cost of the vehicle. Vehicle technologies with a longer history 
and large manufacturing volumes will hold a cost advantage in terms of manufacturing economies of scale. 
Many traditional Indian buses, for example, are mass-produced using a truck body, and are some of the 
lowest-cost buses in the world, but they leave much to be desired from the point-of-view of customer 
comfort. New vehicle technologies will generally have lower manufacturing volumes and may incur additional 
research and tooling costs (Figure 20.47).

overall costs.}{TCRP BRT image library.}

The location of the manufactured vehicle will also be a factor. Production sites in developing countries 
will often hold an advantage in terms of labor and site costs. Further, locally manufactured vehicles 
will have lower shipping costs to arrive at the destination city. However, in some instances, locally 
manufactured vehicles may raise quality issues in comparison to developed-nation production sites. 

In some cases, the vehicle manufacturers themselves have determined that certain branches of their 
own company are responsible for specific regions, even though they may not be the lowest-cost producers. 
For example, the cost of good-quality name- brand buses in Africa is sometimes more expensive, only because 
the manufacturers have determined that the African market is to be supplied by the European branch, rather 
than the Latin American or Asian branch of the company. The following factors are likely to strongly 
influence local vehicles procurement costs:
\item Chassis cost;
\item Body Cost; 
\item Sales tax;
\item Licensing and paperwork fees and costs;
\item Circulation permit costs;
\item Operational insurance costs;
\item Financing cost;
\item Projected vehicle life;
\item Projected resale value;
\item Projected repair requirements.

For imported vehicles, there will be the following additional cost considerations:
\item CIF costs;
\item Shipping costs;
\item Shipping insurance costs;
\item Local port storage fees;
\item Tariffs;
\item Value-added tax;
\item Local customizing costs;
\item Domestic transportation costs from ports to cities.

Table 20.10 breaks down how different elements that go into choosing the best type of vehicle for a 
public-transport system affect the overall vehicle price.

Table 20.11 provides a summary of vehicle-cost estimation based on technology types and location of 
manufacturer. However, these costs could be significantly underestimated, particularly in the case of 
Africa, which has limited proximate vehicle-manufacturing capability, high financing costs, and high 
duties and value-added taxes.

Determining an aggregate cost might be difficult, considering there are several determining factors 
involved. However, it is advisable for BRT project managers to communicate with local vehicle manufacturers 
throughout the process, as this will allow for a comparison of all price options pertinent to vehicle 
choice. 

In practical terms, a joint work effort will be required between system operational design and the 
business plan. An iterative process will help to find an optimal vehicle technology solution that both 
meets a high-level of customer comfort as well as achieves cost-effectiveness.
