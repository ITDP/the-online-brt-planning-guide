> The system of nature, of which man is a part, tends to be self-balancing, self-adjusting, self-cleansing. Not so with technology. (Small is Beautiful)
@ E.F. Schumacher, economist, 1911–77

In addition to complying with the governing legislation, the project must define its minimum environmental 
standards. Because of the profitability of BRT, it is usually possible to set a higher environmental 
standard on BRT vehicles than is required under the law without compromising the profitability of operations. 
As BRT projects play an important role in improving environmental conditions, raising environmental standards 
that can be financially sustained is generally recommended. 

Generally, the following must be considered in assessing the environmental quality of a system:
\item Emission levels;
\item Ambient air-quality standards;
\item Fuel quality;
\item Fuel type and propulsion system;
\item Levels on interior and exterior noise;
\item Ventilation and temperature standards (air renewal/time unit).

In the needs-assessment phase of the project, it is important to set the environmental goal. From an 
emissions standpoint, there is no one clear technical solution that is necessarily superior to another. 
Much will also depend on the availability of a particular fuel. Each fuel carries with it different trade-offs 
of costs, emissions, infrastructure, and potential operating constraints. In some instances, a fuel may 
emit less of one type of pollutant, but more of another type of pollutant. For example, CNG may do well 
in terms of reducing particulate emissions, but its life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions may not offer 
a significant advantage over diesel technology. 

Some fuels may produce less local emissions, but may produce significant emissions at the point of 
electricity generation. Some fuels may produce few emissions from the standpoint of fuel tank-to-wheels 
but can produce significant emissions when the full fuel cycle is considered (e.g., well-to-wheels). 
For example, electric vehicles and hydrogen-fueled vehicles may produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, 
but the emissions generated at the power-plant or through the hydrogen generation process can be quite 
substantial. Some fuels may work well in ideal conditions, but are more polluting in circumstances when 
maintenance and road conditions are poor, or at high altitudes.

\subsection{ Emission Standards}

\beginbox{BRT Standard: Minimizing Bus Emissions – 3 points maximum}

Bus tailpipe emissions 
are typically a large source of urban air pollution. Especially at risk are 
bus passengers and people 
living or working near roadsides. In general, the pollutant emissions of highest 
concern from urban 
buses are particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Minimizing these emissions 
is critical 
to the health of both passengers and the general urban population.



The primary determinant of tailpipe 
emission levels is the stringency of governments’ emissions standards. 
While some fuels, like natural 
gas, tend to produce lower emissions, new emission controls have enabled 
even diesel buses to meet extremely 
clean standards. However, “clean” fuels do not guarantee low emissions 
of all pollutants. As a result, 
our scoring is based on certified emissions standards rather than fuel 
type. Over the last two decades, 
the European Union and the United States have adopted a series of progressively 
tighter emissions standards 
that are being used for this scoring system. Buses must be in compliance 
with Euro VI and U.S. 2010 
emission standards to receive 3 points. These standards result in extremely 
low emissions of both PM 
and NOx. For diesel vehicles, these standards require the use of PM traps, ultra-low-sulfur 
diesel fuel, 
and selective catalytic reduction. To receive two points, buses need to be certified to 
Euro IV or V 
with PM traps (note: 50 ppm sulfur diesel fuel or lower is required for PM traps to function 
effectively).



Vehicles 
certified to the Euro IV and V standards that do not require traps emit twice as much PM as 
vehicles 
meeting more recent standards. Therefore, these vehicles are awarded one point. Ideally, buses 
will 
include contractually stipulated requirements in the purchase order to control real-world NOx emissions 

from buses in use, because the actual NOx emissions from urban buses certified to Euro IV and V have 

been tested at levels substantially higher than certified levels. Because that is hard to verify, it 

is included as a recommendation, but not as a requirement, for receiving the one point.



Zero points 
are awarded for U.S. 2004 and Euro III standards and less stringent standards, because 
these standards 
allow ten times as much PM emissions as the U.S. 2010 and Euro VI standards.



Buses also generate greenhouse 
gas emissions. Since no clear regulatory framework exists that requires 
bus manufacturers to meet specific 
greenhouse-gas emission targets or fuel-efficiency standards, there 
is no obvious way to identify a 
fuel-efficient bus by vehicle type. For CO2 impacts, we recommend the 
use of the TEEMP model, which 
incorporates The BRT Standard into a broader assessment of project-specific 
CO2 impacts.

Emission standards are the most typical mechanism for differentiating between the emissions levels 
of different vehicle options. The standards set forward by the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (US EPA) and the European Commission are most typically used to classify emission performance 
of different technologies. Table 20.5 gives an indication of how European and US EPA standards are 
related in terms of Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions. For the most part, the 
two systems follow similar long-term objectives, although there are a few differences.

In many developing nations, the “Euro” (i.e., European) standards are being applied. Table 20.6 provides 
more detail on the Euro emissions standards, along with the likely fuel and technology requirements.

In order to achieve desired emissions standards or reductions from existing vehicles, several different 
components of the emissions-control program must be taken into account, including:
\item Fuel quality;
\item Engine technologies;
\item Emission-control technologies; 
\item Inspection and maintenance program; and
\item Driver training.

In order to ensure the greatest possible emissions reductions from both the new vehicles and the existing 
fleet, a comprehensive emissions-control program will be required. 

In determining the appropriate emissions standards and technologies within a specific city or fleet 
perspective, many considerations must be taken into account, including the reliability of the fuel supply 
to meet quality standards, the mechanisms and incentives that are in place to ensure follow-up and compliance 
with driver training and maintenance procedures, and the applicability of the technology in context to 
the operating conditions of the fleet. Each component has a different ramification in the developing-nation 
context. Can the quality of the incoming fuel be assured, and how will adulteration of fuels be avoided? 
If advanced engine and emission-control technologies are utilized, how robust are these technologies 
in developing-city conditions? If an improved driver and maintenance program is established, what mechanisms 
and incentives are in place to ensure follow-up and compliance?

In addition to emission standards, system planners may also specify the maximum allowable age of vehicles 
operating on the system. The age specification will help to maintain long-term system quality as well 
as ensure all private operators are competing on an equal basis. The maximum age will also play a fundamental 
role in calculating the operator’s amortization rate for the vehicle. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image27.jpeg}{Technology is not the only solution to ensuring low emissions, as maintenance, 
fuel quality, and driving habits all contribute to the actual emission levels.}{Lloyd Wright}

\subsection{ Fuel Quality}

In a BRT project, it is fairly typical that the BRT authority has control over the vehicle standard, 
but only limited influence on the fuel standard and fuel availability. However, in several cases a BRT 
project has been used to pressure the energy companies to provide cleaner fuels. The additional operational 
controls within a BRT system may make it possible to ensure a higher-quality fuel supply than is available 
within the rest of the city, and should make it possible to reduce the problems of fuel adulteration. 
In any case, the technical specification has to be set with awareness of available fuel quality. In Ecuador, 
the city of Quito maintains higher-fuel quality standards than other cities in the country. This higher 
level is in part due to the city’s unique climatic and geographical conditions, 2,800 meters of elevation, 
as well as the presence of a BRT system.

It is generally best to set the minimum-allowable vehicle-emission standard without specifying a specific 
technology, as this gives the operator greater flexibility to consider a range of factors such as fuel 
costs, fuel availability, maintenance, reliability, refueling times, and performance when complying with 
the standard. These factors will vary by location and situation, and the private sector may be in the 
best position to weigh the relative economic value of each factor. For instance, in Bogotá, the BRT authority 
specifies that vehicles must meet a minimum Euro II emission standard and have set forward a schedule 
to move towards Euro IV standards. TransMilenio does not specify a particular fuel or propulsion technology. 
These decisions are left to the private operators. There are also incentives in place for operators to 
propose vehicles exceeding the minimum standard. Such operators receive more points during the bidding 
process.

For BRT, the cleanest new vehicles that are compatible with available fuel quality are generally advisable. 
In some cases, BRT systems have been operated with a mismatch between the vehicle technology and the 
available fuel (Figure 20.28). Somewhat cleaner vehicles may be able to cope with dirtier fuels but may 
face increased maintenance issues. While Euro II and III vehicles are generally more forgiving than Euro 
IV or V vehicles, higher sulfur levels than are found in certification fuels may still increase maintenance 
costs for sensitive electronic engine equipment, such as high-pressure or common rail fuel injection. 
Lower sulfur fuels will reduce maintenance costs and improve vehicle durability for all vehicles, regardless 
of emissions standard.

\figure{assets/image28.jpeg}{On the Quito Central Norte corridor, the Euro III-compliant vehicles are 
not producing the desired results due to the use of 500 parts per million of sulfur in diesel fuel.}{Lloyd Wright}

However, in some instances, there may be reason to specify a particular fuel type. In Delhi, India, 
all public-transport vehicles have been mandated to utilize compressed natural gas (CNG) as fuel (Figure 
20.29). Adulterated fuels are those that have been tampered with by suppliers in order to improve their 
profits. For example, some fuel suppliers in India mix kerosene, which is subject to much lower taxation 
rates, into the diesel. The result of fuel adulteration such as this is poorly performing vehicles, higher 
emissions and air pollution, and more costly maintenance requirements. Thus, requiring Euro II or Euro 
III technology can be meaningless in such a scenario, since there is little control on the input fuel. 
By contrast, it is quite difficult to adulterate CNG, and thus its quality is more assured. Despite the 
rationale of this course and the relative availability of CNG in India, Delhi’s conversion from diesel 
fuels to CNG has been fraught with conflicts and political recriminations. Ultimately, it required the 
intervention of the national Supreme Court to ensure that the conversion process was finally undertaken. 


\figure{assets/image29.jpeg}{All public-transport vehicles in Delhi, including the oldest vehicles, 
faced a mandatory conversion to CNG fuel in order to overcome difficulties with adulterated fuels. }{Lloyd Wright}

\subsection{ Fuel Types and Propulsion Systems}

Many governments and promoters of clean technology rightly see BRT as a possibility for introducing 
cleaner vehicle technology. Because of BRT’s profitability, it creates the potential of having a much 
cleaner vehicle without undermining the profitability of the service. However, this profitability is 
case-specific, and clean technologies should not be forced on BRT systems without first assessing the 
impact the technology will have on the quality of service, the profitability of the system, the transparency 
of the vehicle procurement process, and other factors. 

The choice of fuel and propulsion technology will have a profound impact on operating costs, maintenance 
costs, supporting infrastructure, as well as emission levels. Local circumstances play a central role 
in fuel choice, as the availability of a fuel and experience in maintaining a particular vehicle technology 
are key factors. Further, as attention focuses more and more on the human and environmental costs of 
both local pollutants and global climate change, system developers are under increasing pressure to deliver 
cleaner vehicles options. 

The following is a list of some of the most common fuel options currently being considered for public-transport 
vehicles (Figure 20.30):
\item Diesel, both standard and clean;
\item Compressed natural gas (CNG);
\item Liquid petroleum gas (LPG);
\item Electric trolleybuses;
\item Bio-fuels, such as bio-diesel and ethanol;
\item Hybrid-electric (diesel-electric and CNG-electric);
\item Hydrogen (fuel-cell technology).

\figure[medium]{assets/image30.png}{Fuel and propulsion system options. Image}{ ITDP.}

A range of other possibilities also exists, such as fly-wheel technology, di-methyl ether (DME), and 
blended fuels (e.g., water-in-oil emulsions). 

Choosing the type of engines that will be purchased and the fuel that will be used requires that consideration 
be given to several important issues. The following factors are the most important when considering a 
fuel and propulsion technology: 
\item Fuel availability and price volatility;
\item Vehicle cost;
\item Reliability;
\item Government policy;
\item Environmental impact.

*Diesel (Standard and Clean)*

A clean-diesel system implies that the propulsion-system technology and the fuel quality are such that 
the end result is much lower emissions than a standard diesel vehicle. The International Energy Agency 
notes that (IEA, 2002b, p. 61):

“Diesel engines are recognized and favored worldwide for their fuel efficiency, excellent durability 
and low maintenance requirements. They offer the convenience of using a liquid fuel that is easily dispensed 
through an established fueling infrastructure. The technology is mature, widely produced and competitively 
priced. Although diesel engines have historically produced high levels of pollutant emissions, especially 
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), recent improvements in engines and fuel and emissions-control 
technology have resulted in new diesel systems for buses that are substantially cleaner than they were 
only a few years ago.”

For diesel, sulfur content is the most critical factor to consider, as many of the pollution-control 
devices used in the cleaner buses require lower sulfur fuels. In some cities, diesel fuels may contain 
over 2000 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur. To achieve Euro II standards, a sulfur level of less than 
500 ppm is likely to be required. To achieve “ultra-low-sulfur diesel” (ULSD), the fuel must contain 
less than 50 ppm. Many emission-control technologies will only function properly if the fuel sulfur levels 
are below acceptable levels.

Reducing sulfur from diesel fuel also carries with it other emissions benefits, such as simultaneously 
also reducing particulate matter (PM), which is a key pollutant from a public-health perspective. As 
shown in Figure 20.31, sulfur contributes to the production of particulate matter in all diesel engines. 
At higher sulfur levels, sulfate can account for up to 5 to 15 percent of PM emissions from diesel. At 
lower sulfur levels, after-treatment emissions controls can reduce PM emissions much more substantially, 
either as retrofit devices or as standard equipment on new vehicles meeting more stringent standards. 
Diesel oxidation catalysts, which can reduce PM emissions by 20 to 30 percent, can generally be used 
with sulfur levels up to 500 ppm. Diesel particulate filters, which can reduce more than 90 percent of 
PM emissions, generally require sulfur levels to be under 50 ppm. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image31.png}{There is a close relationship between the emissions of sulfur and emissions 
of particulate matter (PM).}{ Luis Willumsen.}

Hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and even nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also affected by emissions 
standards and contingent on fuel quality. As can be seen in Table 20.5, the Euro standards are scheduled 
to reduce emissions of all major pollutants. Euro II and III each represent a 60 percent reduction in 
PM emissions from the previous standards. Euro IV standards have 80 percent lower PM emissions than Euro 
III, and thus representing a 97-percent reduction from Euro I standards. The cleaner the vehicle, however, 
the more sensitive it is to fuel quality.

Emissions from diesel vehicles will vary depending on local conditions such as altitude, atmospheric 
pressure, humidity, and climate. The quality of ongoing vehicle maintenance and the integrity of the 
fuel supply chain will also affect specific system emissions. Nevertheless, with the right fuel quality, 
diesel vehicles can produce emissions reductions in line with many of the more costly alternative fuels. 
In general, it can do so with a lower vehicle cost and with a more robust maintenance regime.

*Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)*

CNG is highly touted as a reliable fuel option that “inherently” achieves lower emissions. CNG contains 
virtually no sulfur and naturally burns quite cleanly. However, CNG is not a perfect solution. For some 
emission types, the performance of CNG may not be that much better than clean diesel vehicles.

In the case of greenhouse-gas emissions, the entire well-to-wheels analysis of CNG production, distribution, 
and use may imply that there is little, if any, advantage over diesel. Upstream methane losses along 
pipelines can significantly increase total life-cycle greenhouse emissions for CNG. Some studies estimate 
that with the inclusion of methane leakage, CNG will actually produce significantly more total greenhouse-gas 
emissions (CVTF, 2000). 

There are also other issues to consider with CNG. The low energy density of the fuel means that the 
gas must be compressed for on-board storage in large, bulky cylinders. CNG vehicles also require different 
maintenance skills that may not be common. In some cases, CNG vehicles may face power issues on steep 
hills, at high altitudes, and in some temperatures. The refueling infrastructure for CNG can also be 
costly to develop. 

Refueling time is also a consideration for CNG vehicles. Typically, refueling time per vehicle will 
range from 20 to 40 minutes. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image32.jpeg}{Los Angeles has developed the infrastructure to use CNG technology for 
the entire fleet on its Orange Line.}{Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transport Authority.}

Nevertheless, CNG holds much potential for emission reductions of PM and sulfur oxides, and thus, if 
the fuel is available locally, then the technology should be given serious consideration. Further, as 
experience grows with CNG, the technology is becoming increasingly robust from a maintenance standpoint.

*Electric-Trolley Vehicles*

Electric-trolley vehicles are a well-established technology that produces zero emissions at the point 
of use. The total fuel-cycle emissions of electric-operated vehicles will depend upon the fuel used in 
the electricity generation. Fossil-fuel-based electricity generation, such as electricity from coal or 
petroleum, will produce high levels of total emissions, while renewable sources, such as hydro-electric 
and wind sources, will be relatively emission free. Thus, in countries with clean electricity generation, 
electric trolleys can be a low-emitting option to consider. Electric-trolley vehicles are also extremely 
quiet in operation. Table 20.6 summarizes the different issues to consider in choosing electric-trolley 
technology.

*Biofuels (Ethanol and Bio-Diesel)*

Ethanol is a fuel produced from the fermentation of sugars in carbohydrates, derived from agricultural 
crops like corn and grains, wood, or animal wastes. Currently, ethanol is derived predominantly from 
corn and sugar cane (Figure 20.33). Brazil possesses an extensive ethanol program using sugar cane. In 
the future, cellulosic ethanol may become viable, in which the fuel can be derived from a broader range 
of plant and agricultural species. However, commercial production of cellulosic ethanol is yet to be 
fully realized.

\figure{assets/image33.jpeg}{Sugar cane production in Mauritius.}{Lloyd Wright}

Bio-diesel is a fuel derived from biological sources that can be used in diesel engines instead of 
petroleum-derived diesel. Through the process of transesterification, the triglycerides in the biologically 
derived oils are separated from the glycerin, creating a combustible fuel. Bio-diesel fuel is currently 
derived predominantly from soya. 

Biofuels hold the potential to deliver a product with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions. The CO2 emitted 
by biofuels can be balanced by the CO\sub{2} absorbed during plant growth, potentially resulting in a fixed 
carbon cycle. However, the reality is more complicated. Total greenhouse emissions from biofuel production 
are still quite poorly understood, including certain factors that could increase net greenhouse gas emissions 
considerably. These factors include: energy inputs into the cultivation of crops; secondary emissions 
that have climate-change impacts (e.g., black soot); amount of fertilizer use and resultant emissions 
of nitrous oxide (N\sub{2}O); amount of pesticide use; and, type of biomass being displaced by energy crops. 
In some instances, such as soy-based fuels, the resulting greenhouse-gas emissions from nitrogen releases 
may overwhelm other benefits (Deluchi, 2003). Additionally, it is unclear if the amount of agricultural 
land is sufficient to produce biofuels in a quantity sufficient to dramatically offset petroleum fuels 
(IEA, 2004).

Biofuel production may have an array of other unintended side effects. As the market for biofuel builds, 
there will be growing pressure on sensitive ecosystems to be converted into crop production. This phenomenon 
is already clearly evident in the Amazon region of Brazil, where increased demand for soya is leading 
to further illegal destruction of the Amazon ecosystem. Each year, approximately 20,000 square kilometers 
of the Amazon rainforest are cleared for agricultural use (Economist, 2006). More intensive biofuel production 
can also imply greater depletion of input resources such as soil quality and water (Figures 20.34 and 
20.35).

\figure{assets/image34.jpeg}{The growing demand for soy has fueled further destruction of the Amazon 
rainforest.}{ iStockphotos.}

\figure[medium]{assets/image35.jpeg}{As the demand for biofuel increases, production inputs, such as water, 
will also come under increasing demand. }{Lloyd Wright.}

There is also increasing concern over the impact biofuel production will have upon food prices. It 
is reported that the grain required to fill the typical 95-liter petrol tank of a sport utility vehicle 
with ethanol will feed one person for a year. The grain to fill the tank every two weeks over a year 
will feed 26 people (Brown, 2006). In the United States, the amount of the corn (maize) crop dedicated 
to ethanol production increased 34 percent from 2006 to 2005. In 2006, some 54 million tons of maize 
went to ethanol production, even though ethanol only represents a small percentage of the fuel used in 
vehicles in the United States (Planet Ark, 2006). In late 2006, an increase in maize prices due to biofuel 
demand caused tortilla prices to triple in Mexico. Since tortillas represent the staple of the local 
diet, many low-income families were severely affected by these increases. With strong protests from the 
population, the government was eventually forced to adapt price controls. These types of conflicts may 
become more common as the market for biofuels expands.

*Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (Diesel-Electric and CNG-Electric)*

Hybrid-electric vehicles will likely be one of the first of the advanced technologies to gain large-scale 
acceptance in the market. Hybrids utilize both conventional fuels (e.g., diesel, CNG, etc.) and electrical 
motors to propel the drive-train. Electric power can be generated during vehicle deceleration and then 
utilized to operate motors attached to each wheel. Since electric motors are used for part of the vehicle’s 
operation, hybrids offer superior fuel economy, reduced emissions, and lower noise levels (Figure 20.36). 


\figure{assets/image36.png}{The potential of hybrid-electric vehicles to cost-effectively reduce tailpipe 
emissions has drawn the attention of most manufacturers.}{ Volvo.}

However, even with this technology, the emission-reduction benefits can vary depending on the driving-duty 
cycle. The city of Seattle, Washington, USA has made one of the largest investments in hybrid-electric 
technology within its bus system. However, despite manufacturer claims of fuel efficiency gains of 25 
percent or more, the initial results in Seattle were significantly less due to the route choice (Hadley, 
2004). If the bus-duty cycle does not involve sufficient stop-and-go travel, then the efficiency gains 
from regenerative braking are not realized. The additional weight of the hybrid-electric vehicle offsets 
the gains from the on-board electricity generation (Wright and Fulton, 2005). 

Like all new technologies, a certain period of adjustments and experimentation are required prior to 
optimum results being achieved. However, the complexity of propulsion system and cost of the hybrid components 
mean that hybrids may not be well suited for all developing city applications. 

Currently, efforts are being made to produce hybrid-electric vehicles in Brazil. Because of various 
local conditions, such as lack of driver familiarity with the technology, the environmental benefits 
have been less than anticipated, but the problems are likely to be resolvable. 

*Hydrogen (Fuel-Cell Technology)*

National research and development budgets have heavily invested in fuel-cell technologies. In 2003, 
the United States launched its five-year Hydrogen Fuel Cell Initiative with a commitment of US$1.7 billion 
in research funding. Likewise, the European Union is supporting a US$3.7 billion public-private partnership 
in a 10-year fuel cell development program. In 2003, Japan dedicated US$268 million of its government 
research budget to fuel cells. Likewise, other governments such as Canada and China also have their own 
fuel-cell program (Science, 2004). 

Fuel-cell vehicles are undergoing testing in both developed and developing cities. Through a grant 
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), several developing cities, such as Beijing and Cairo, have 
had an opportunity to evaluate the technology. However, none of these cities are actually operating full 
fleets with these technologies. The costs, environmental benefits, and performance of these vehicles 
are not entirely proven. Since most hydrogen is currently produced from electrolysis, the emissions benefits 
are directly tied to the type of technology utilized for the generation of the electricity.

The International Energy Agency notes that there are no certainties when hydrogen fuel cells will become 
commercially viable (IEA, 2004). Hydrogen storage capabilities, the dependence on expensive rare-metal 
catalysts (e.g., platinum), and the development of appropriate infrastructure all represent formidable 
uncertainties in the timely delivery of a commercial product. By depending solely on a technology without 
a known delivery date, action on transport-sector emissions can be significantly delayed:

“…by skewing research toward costly large-scale demonstrations of technology well before it’s ready 
for market, governments risk repeating a pattern that has sunk previous technologies, such as synfuels 
in the 1980s. By focusing research on technologies that aren’t likely to have a measurable impact until 
the second half of the century, the current hydrogen push fails to address the growing threat from greenhouse 
gas emissions from fossil fuels” (Science, 2004).”

\subsection{ Fuel Availability and Price Volatility}

Not all fuels are widely available. Many alternative fuels may simply not be available at the time 
that the BRT system is going into operation, and thus fuel availability will constrain the selection 
of propulsion technology. 

Diesel and electricity are by far the most widely available fuels. Low-sulfur diesel is available in 
a growing number of countries, but its availability is still fairly limited in developing countries. 
Current price levels in different countries are well documented through the GIZ International Fuel Prices 
publication (Wagner et al., 2012/2013). As evidenced in Figure 20.37, subsidy and tax levels can make 
a significant difference in actual fuel costs.

\figure[large]{assets/image37.jpeg}{The yellow and red areas represent countries with significant fuel subsidies as of November 
2012.}{International Fuel Prices 2012/2013 provided by GIZ.}

Natural gas as a bus fuel requires a supply network in close proximity to fleet maintenance and parking 
areas. Some cities have natural gas and others do not. Some cities have the gas, but have not yet invested 
in the specialized equipment such as the pipeline, compressors, dehumidifiers, and other equipment necessary 
to make the fuel usable as a bus fuel. When Delhi, India, was forced to switch to natural gas, the lack 
of sufficient sources of supply led to severe disruption of bus services. TransJakarta also faced a similar 
problem where buses would have to queue in long lines due to the lack of refueling stations. These problems 
can be mitigated with proper planning. 

Hydrogen fuel cells are currently not commercially viable without massive subsidies, but an additional 
problem is the availability of hydrogen. Hydrogen is not found in any substantial quantities in the natural 
environment. For this reason, hydrogen is not really a fuel type, but rather it is an energy carrier, 
in a similar manner that an electric battery is an energy carrier. Most of the hydrogen fuel-cell projects 
developed to date have relied upon electrolysis, which generates the hydrogen from passing an electrical 
current through water. This requires special equipment and electricity. The other likely source of hydrogen 
is natural gas, which then requires a natural-gas supply. Both approaches require expensive specialized 
equipment. Further, depending on how the electricity is generated to produce the hydrogen, the life-cycle 
emissions from a fuel-cell vehicle can actually be considerably higher than a standard diesel vehicle.

The electricity for electric trolleybuses is less of a problem than the cost and maintenance of the 
electric conduit and the electricity stations that feed them. Electric-diesel hybrids which do not require 
electric conduits mitigate the need for expensive conduits. 

In every case, a vulnerability and risk analysis associated with fuel-supply systems is necessary, 
as public services like transportation cannot risk interruptions in operation due to problems within 
gas pipes tubes or power outages.

The risk of future fuel-price volatility is a related issue. System operators will want to insulate 
themselves against the risk of sudden future increases in fuel prices. A vehicle technology should be 
selected which reduces the risk of future fuel price increases.

viability.}{Lloyd Wright.}

While predicting future fuel supplies is difficult, this risk can be mitigated by having the vehicle 
operator negotiate long-term fixed-rate contracts with the relevant fuel suppliers, or by buying futures 
options in the fuel. The risk can also be mitigated by the use of vehicle technologies that can run on 
multiple fuel types.

If a city has a nearby natural gas supply, it may be worth the investment in the necessary infrastructure 
and equipment to provide natural gas at the depot, if a reasonably priced long-term supply contract can 
be negotiated with the gas supplier. A local supply of natural gas is important because it is relatively 
easy to pipe but expensive to ship. Similarly, if oil is produced in the country, particularly if it 
is produced by a state-run oil company, it may be possible to negotiate a long-term fixed-rate supply 
contract. 

Conversely, if a country has hydroelectric power, or large supplies of coal, or declining electricity 
demand (as in the case of the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union) it may be that future electricity supplies are more predictable than prices for diesel 
or natural gas. Again, the issue may be more whether or not a long-term supply contract can be negotiated. 
It is not enough to assume that a government company will mean stable future fuel prices. System operators 
should still protect themselves with long-term supply contracts or futures contracts. Long-term supply 
contracts also may be possible from commercial providers, though they will cost more. 

In the case of Quito, for example, the decision to go with electric trolleybuses was initially related 
to low electricity costs. While the initially low electricity rates made the operational costs competitive 
with diesel-based systems, a subsequent deregulation of the Ecuadorian electricity sector has seen electricity 
costs increase.

\subsection{ Reliability}

Reliability of the propulsion technology is a major concern for a BRT system. Vehicle breakdowns in 
a BRT system are more serious than in a normal bus operation, because a broken down bus will congest 
the BRT lane and lead to a significant disruption of service. 

One of the main advantages of diesel fuel is that the vehicle technology is more mature, and with proper 
maintenance, vehicle breakdowns are more predictable and easier to repair (Figure 20.39). 

\figure{assets/image39.jpeg}{Diesel technology has a long operational track record, and thus the technology’s 
robustness and maintenance requirements are well known.}{Lloyd Wright.}

Electric trolleybuses themselves have excellent maintenance records, but there can be problems with 
power failures and maintenance failures in the electric conduits. Electric trolleybus technology is used 
in São Paulo’s Corredor Metropolitano ABD BRT system in São Paulo. Some operational problems were experienced 
due to poor maintenance of the overhead conduit line, but it could be partially controlled by turning 
over control of conduit maintenance to the vehicle operator, who has a bigger stake in a breakdown than 
the power company.

In any case, most important is a maintenance contract with the supplier. In the case of TransMilenio 
in Bogotá, manufacturers have staff at the depot for major repairs (Figure 20.40). It is therefore critical 
that the degree of technical support offered by the vehicle supplier be a major consideration in the 
procurement contract. In Quito, for example, Spanish electric trolleybus suppliers were selected over 
lower-cost Russian suppliers, largely because of the quality of maintenance support offered. 

\figure{assets/image40.jpeg}{Many of the operating companies in Bogotá directly contract the vehicle 
manufacturers to provide maintenance services for the vehicles.}{Lloyd Wright.}

If the risks of vehicle breakdown are extremely high, local maintenance capacity is low, and the ability 
of the local operators to mobilize capital is weak, it may be worth exploring the option of leasing the 
vehicles from the manufacturer. 

For any vehicle, it is also advisable to run fuel and general-performance tests locally that simulate 
the anticipated conditions of operation, before reaching a decision. Vehicles that work well in developed 
countries in temperate climates may work poorly in tropical climates on poor roads with major drainage 
problems. 

\subsection{ Noise}

Acceptable noise levels should also be specified within the vehicle-procurement specifications. Excessively 
loud vehicles are both a health hazard and a detriment to the marketing image of the public transport 
service. 

Noise levels are determined by several variables including:
\item Fuel and propulsion system technology;
\item Design of propulsion system;
\item Size of vehicle relative to engine size;
\item Dampening technologies and exhaust system employed;
\item Quality of road surface; and
\item Maintenance practices.

Some fuel and propulsion systems, such as electric vehicles, are naturally quiet. In other instances, 
the design of the propulsion system can encourage smooth operation, as well as the dampening of sounds. 
Ensuring incentives for well-maintained vehicles and roads will also help achieve lower noise levels. 
In Bogotá, the vehicle specifications mandate that internal noise levels of the vehicles are not to exceed 
90 decibels.

A very quiet vehicle does introduce other issues. Electric-trolleybus technology operates with little 
noise. However, in turn, the lack of noise can create a hazard for pedestrians who may not be aware of 
the presence of an oncoming vehicle. This type of hazard is particularly a concern for the sight-impaired, 
who are often quite dependent on noise to guide their movements. 

\subsection{ Ventilation and Temperature Standards}

The presence or absence of climate control inside the vehicles can have an enormous impact, not only 
on the quality of service, but also on the costs of operations. In some climate conditions, air conditioning 
is not that critical to customer comfort, but in other cases, the lack of air conditioning alone may 
be enough to induce middle- and upper-income customers to stay in cars. Requiring air conditioning is 
critical to a high status image for the system, but it will also put upward pressure on the fare, because 
vehicles will be more expensive and will use more fuel. As a general rule, climate control inside the 
vehicles is preferred, if it is at all possible, given the profitability of the system. 

Whether air conditioning is used or not, attention should be given to the amount of air turnover inside 
the vehicle. In highly crowded vehicles, the air quality can quickly deteriorate without adequate ventilation.
