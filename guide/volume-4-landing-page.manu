Volume 4 looks at the necessary planning required to ensure the financial stability and success of the business of running a BRT system. This includes looking at the institutional and business structure as a whole, the contracting for different aspects of the system such as operating vehicles and operating the traffic control center.

A number of varying institutional structures have been used to run BRT systems, and this volume discusses the basic and administrative tasks required as well as some of the pros and cons inherent in varying setups in taking on those tasks (Chapter 12).

Furthermore, this volume includes guidance on the business of operations, contracting, and competitive tendering (Chapter 13); financial modeling (Chapter 14); setting up the systems fare policy and structure (Chapter 15); and finalizing a finance plan (Chapter 16).
