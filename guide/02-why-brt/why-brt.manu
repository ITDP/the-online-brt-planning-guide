The choice of rapid transit technology will affect travel times, personal transport expenditures, and 
commuter comfort. The choice will also dramatically affect government finances and a city’s economic 
efficiency. Ultimately, the selection will shape a city’s urban form and the lifestyles of its inhabitants. 
But the choice should be guided first and foremost by what type of service is needed. Technology then 
becomes the tool to provide that service.


Choosing the appropriate rapid transit technology for a city requires balancing what citizens want 
and where they want it with more technical considerations such as costs and potential benefits. This 
chapter summarizes the technical differences among three main mass transit options: Bus Rapid Transit 
(BRT), Light-Rail Transit (LRT), and Heavy Rail Transit (HRT).  


When deciding on the type of rapid transit most appropriate for a city, cost, performance, implementation 
speed, scalability, and local preferences all need to be taken into consideration. For most cities, the 
costs of different rapid transit alternatives, both capital and operating expenditures, should be preeminent 
decision-making factors. Even wealthier cities will benefit from cost-effective investments, offering 
greater benefits per dollar of investment. As the economic and social benefits of funds invested in rapid 
transit need to be weighed against other economic and social investments, an effort should be made to 
get the greatest social benefit per dollar of investment possible. The quality of the service, including 
the capacity, the speed, and the comfort of the service are also very important. People will willingly 
pay more for a higher speed and more comfortable service, and some corridors have more potential riders 
and require a higher capacity service. 


The flexibility and scalability of the system also matters. Perhaps normal existing transit speeds 
are very fast in a city everywhere except in one area such as downtown. A high-speed congestion-free 
service may be needed in the congested area but not elsewhere. For different transit modes, there are 
different minimum operable lengths, which are the shortest segments that make sense to build and still 
bring benefits. The costs of the stations, vehicles, rights-of-way, and other factors will change this 
length for various modes. Some modes are easy to build in small segments, while other modes make financial 
sense in larger segments. There is also a benefit to expanding existing modes, as services and infrastructure 
can be connected more seamlessly. 


As all public investments are ultimately political, they require some sort of mandate from the political 
leadership and the general public. Because politics and public opinion change rapidly, implementation 
speed is also very important. If a project can be implemented during a single term of political office, 
it stands a greater chance of being implemented, and its benefits can be realized more quickly. 


Economic development impacts also matter. If one type of rapid transit is known to have a greater economic 
development impact, this would also affect investment decisions. Many cities are looking to rapid transit 
investments to help stimulate economic development in particular locations to guide urban growth to strategic 
locations. This chapter reviews how BRT, LRT, and HRT options vary with respect to each of these issues.
