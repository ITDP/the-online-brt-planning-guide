\section{ Defining Rapid Transit Modes }

Public transportation includes all publically accessible transportation services that convey people 
in common vehicles from one place to another. These services generally run on fixed routes at regularly 
scheduled intervals. Rapid transit is a form of public transportation on a fixed route that includes 
features that dramatically improve the speed, capacity, reliability, and quality of the service.

\subsection{ Defining BRT}

BRT is:

\quotation {... a bus-based rapid transit system that can achieve high capacity and speed at relatively low cost 
by combining segregated bus lanes that are typically median aligned, off-board fare collection, level 
boarding, bus priority at intersections, and other quality-of-service elements (such as information technology 
and strong branding).}
{ *BRT Standard*, 2015}

Five essential elements put the “rapid” in bus rapid transit: 

\item Physically separated bus lanes allow buses to avoid congestion;
\item Stations and bus lanes aligned to the center of the street to avoid being delayed by turning vehicles 
and vehicles dropping off passengers or goods;
\item Fares collected off the bus, to avoid delays caused by passengers paying on board;
\item Boarding from a platform level with the bus floor to make boarding faster, and so that people 
in wheelchairs or with strollers can roll directly onto the vehicle;
\item Turn restrictions and bus priority at intersections to reduce delay at intersections from red 
signals.

BRT corridors consist of dedicated, physically demarcated bus lanes that are aligned to the center 
of a street or a functionally equivalent configuration for the majority of the corridor. They also include 
one or more of the other three essential elements described above. A more detailed discussion of what 
constitutes a BRT corridor can be found in the *BRT Standard* (\url{www.brtstandard.org}).

\subsection{ Defining Other Rapid Transit Modes }

*Light-Rail Transit (LRT)*: a rail-based rapid transit system that uses predominantly exclusive, 
but not grade-separated, rights-of-way. Like BRT systems, LRTs can have a wide range of passenger capacities 
and performance characteristics. These capacities and performance characteristics are for the most part 
driven by the same essential elements that are critical to BRT system performance. These essential elements 
are defined in the *BRT Standard* (\url{www.brtstandard.org}) and will be discussed in this guide at length. If a rail system 
were to operate (as some do) in mixed traffic, on the curb lane, with turning movements allowed across 
it, where passengers have to pay the driver, and passengers need to step up into the vehicle rather than 
boarding at level, the operating characteristics of the system would be similar to those of a normal 
bus service, as opposed to an LRT. Conversely, an LRT that operates with prepaid boarding, has a dedicated 
right-of-way, operates in the central median of the right-of-way, and has all of the other elements of 
Gold Standard BRT, is likely to provide better service and operate more as a rapid transit system. As 
such, the BRT Standard technical committee has approved the limited use of the BRT standard to also rate 
LRT systems, with certain specific caveats (* BRT Standard*, p. 55). 


*Heavy Rail Transit (HRT):* an electric rail-based public transport system, often referred to as “Metro,” 
with high-passenger-capacity rail cars that generally preclude sharp turning movements and require a 
high platform to board. As such, they cannot generally be operated in normal street conditions, and hence 
require grade-separated rights-of-way. HRT systems have off-board fare collection, operate within a single 
built-up urban area with regular station spacing, and provide all-day bidirectional service with regular 
frequencies. For the purposes of the BRT Planning Guide, HRT will include systems described as commuter 
rail and metros that align with the above definition. As the vehicles cannot operate on normal streets, 
many elements recognized as critical to BRT systems do not apply to HRT systems. Though most HRT systems 
would probably rank “Gold” under the BRT Standard, the BRT Standard Technical Committee has not authorized 
the use of the BRT Standard for rating HRT systems. 

For the purposes of this Planning Guide, what distinguishes LRT from HRT is that it operates for at 
least part of the transit corridor on normal streets and uses shorter train sets with lower capacities. 
As such, LRT tends to have flexible bodies capable of tighter turning radii than HRT systems and tends 
to have floors closer to street level than HRT vehicles. This guide includes in the definition of LRT 
both systems that are generally referred to as “LRTs” as well as some streetcars and trams. 

*Monorail:* a rail-based public transport system composed of a single rail, usually elevated and thus 
grade separated. What differentiates the monorail from LRT of HRT is that monorail trains are wider than 
the guideways that support and guide them. Monorails are only mentioned in passing in this guide, as 
they are very expensive to build given their carrying capacity. Monorail is not a viable mass transit 
solution. Note that the definitions above were adapted from the Transportation Research Board and the 
American Public Transportation Association.\highlight{ }
