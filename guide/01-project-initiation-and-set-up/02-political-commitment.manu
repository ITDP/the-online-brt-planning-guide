\quotation{I have never learned to tune a lute or play upon a harp, but I can take a small and obscure city and raise it to greatness.}

Ultimately, though, a project concept must enter the political mainstream in order to move toward official 
development. A leading political official must make a strong commitment to overhauling the city’s public 
transport system. Political will and commitment are probably the most critical and fundamental components 
in making a new system a reality. Outside groups can certainly help create the right conditions for project 
consideration, but as a public good, public transport requires political support to become a reality. 


While almost all political officials will claim to hold strong political will and commitment to public 
transport, the reality is often quite different. Is an official willing to give priority road space to 
public transport over private vehicles? Will the official risk upsetting powerful lobbying groups, such 
as existing transit operators and private motorists? Will the officials seek out the best technical help 
they can find, and the best financial resources to make a project happen? Convincing officials to say 
yes to each of these questions is the basis of establishing project commitment. “Political will” are 
just words until backed up by tangible evidence of a serious intent to fully implement a project.

There are some risks associated with having one particular individual or party largely responsible 
for developing a bus rapid transit project. In Bogotá and Guadalajara, Mexico, for example, the fact 
that one politician or political party promoted and implemented the BRT system has made it more difficult 
to expand after that individual left office. Thus, political will is important to the success of the 
project, but the initiative itself should be neutral—associated more with the city itself and not an 
individual.

\subsection{Political Officials}

The creation of a political environment suitable to introducing a new public transport system can depend 
on many factors. There is no set amount of time required or set series of events. In the case of cities 
such as Bogotá and Curitiba, the election of dynamic mayors who entered office with a new vision was 
the determining factor. Both former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa of Bogotá and former Mayor Jaime Lerner of 
Curitiba came to office with a strong intent to improve public space and transport (\ref{figure:image4}). 
They also possessed a base knowledge of these topics and brought with them highly trained professionals 
as their core staff. In such instances, the progress toward system planning happens almost immediately.

In other instances, a long period of persuasion and information gathering will precede the commitment. 
Naturally, the more senior the political figure leading the cause, the more likely the official’s influence 
can lead to action. Thus, mayors and governors are the logical targets for gaining political support. 
In many cases, as in Jakarta, Indonesia, key local politicians often quickly realize that BRT can help 
them politically because it can show results within the length of their administration. In some developing 
cities, support from national ministry officials may also be necessary for project approval. The role 
of national officials may be particularly important in capital cities.

In many instances, a mayor or governor will lack the necessary background on transport or urban planning 
issues. It requires confidence to grapple with a widespread transformation of the public transport system. 
In such cases, building the trust of the decision makers and giving them the necessary confidence to 
implement such a seemingly far-reaching proposal will be key. Political officials will be averse to risk 
with key constituencies, such as car owners and transit operators, unless the issue is a core part of 
their platform. 

Further, mayors and governors are busy individuals juggling an array of issues and interests. The amount 
of time these officials can devote to a studied consideration of a public transport transformation is 
limited. For this reason, it may be more effective to target the top advisers of a mayor or governor. 
Such individuals may be able to give the idea greater attention, and then subsequently be in a position 
to make a trusted recommendation to the official.

However, even in the absence of support at the highest levels, a strategy to begin influencing officials 
at lower levels may still merit effort. Fortunately, there are many other starting points within the 
city’s political and institutional environment. Deputy mayors, deputy governors, and councillors are 
also relevant positions from which a project can be launched. Among such officials, it may be more likely 
to find a specialist with a background in transportation, environmental issues, urban planning, or other 
related fields. In such cases, the learning curve will likely be less. In Johannesburg, South Africa, 
the effort was led by a councillor who was the adviser to the mayor on transportation.

Another useful starting point can be unelected officials holding key positions within municipal institutions. 
Directors and staff within departments of planning, public works, environment, health, and transportation 
will all likely play a role in any eventual project. Without the support of such officials and staff, 
institutional inertia can delay and weaken implementation. Further, these officials often have a direct 
relationship with top elected officials. During their daily or weekly briefings, technical staff can 
prompt a discussion of public transport options. A concept being supported by both citizens’ groups and 
departmental directors will stand a better chance of approval by a mayor than a project being pursued 
by just one outside group. 

The best strategy is to approach all relevant officials, both elected and appointed, who may be influential 
on public transport. Even if an official is unlikely to become an overt supporter of a public transport 
initiative, eliminating the threat of overt opposition is equally important. Thus, an initial preemptive 
session with the potential opposition can be vital to reducing any strongly negative reactions. Much 
care must be given to the manner in which the issue is presented to any given audience. In fact, the 
key points to be stressed will likely vary from one official to another, given their different starting 
points and initial understanding of mass transit options.

One common and rather unfortunate complication is the existence of opposing political parties in key 
positions overseeing the project. For example, if the local government control is held by one political 
party while the regional or national government is held by another party, then cooperation to make the 
project a reality may be lacking. The lack of cooperation between national and local officials scuttled 
the Bangkok BRT project until it was finally launched in May 2010 after various delays. While local government 
will typically have direct implementation responsibility, approval from the national government could 
be required for either budgetary or legal reasons. In Colombia, the success of TransMilenio in Bogotá 
generated a strong commitment to implement eight more BRT systems throughout the country, with a contribution 
of up to 70 percent from the national government. Something similar happened in India, where the Jawaharlal 
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) was developed as a financing mechanism to implement suitable 
public transport solutions for its cities, some of which have been designated as BRT systems.

The duration of the political administration’s time in office (and the possibility for reelection) 
is also another key factor to consider. If a mayor or governor has only a short time remaining prior 
to an election, then such officials may be reluctant to embark upon bold initiatives. The risk of alienating 
potential voting groups can override any political boost that a project announcement could garner. Further, 
once an incumbent takes a strongly favorable position on a public transport option, this position may 
imply an equal and opposite reaction from the opposition candidates.  

For these reasons, catching political officials at the earliest stages of their time in office provides 
the best chance for achieving commitment to implementation. Often, a major selling point for mayors and 
governors of an option such as BRT is that it can be built easily within a single term of office, helping 
establish the politician’s career. It may also be effective to introduce public transport options even 
prior to officials taking office. Providing information to staff within the major political parties can 
be a worthwhile investment of time and effort. Identifying potential future leaders and establishing 
a mentoring relationship with them can be equally useful. 

\subsection{Awareness-Raising Mechanisms }

There are several different mechanisms available to help alert political officials to the potential 
of various public transport improvement options. These mechanisms include:
\item Site visits to successful public transport systems;
\item Tours of own city’s existing public transport services;
\item Visits from successful mayors and other successful implementers, such as the directors and commissioners of transport departments;
\item Basic information provision on options;
\item Videos on public transport improvement examples;
\item Simulation videos of potential systems in the particular city;
\item Physical models of public transport options;
\item Pre-feasibility study.

These various mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, as several different information techniques can 
be combined to build a case on the need for change. Frequently, all it takes to generate political interest 
is to provide fairly basic information to mayors and other decision makers. 

In most cases, however, firm political resolve only comes after chief decision makers visit a successful 
system like Mexico City or Guangzhou, China, to see it and understand it for themselves. “Seeing is believing” 
is completely true in the case of BRT. Usually, the decision makers are also accompanied by senior technical 
staff who will be responsible for implementing the project. Members of the city’s media, as well as existing 
transport operators, may also participate in the visit. By speaking directly with technical staff and 
political officials in cities with existing systems, prospective system developers can understand the 
possibilities in their own cities (\ref{figure:image6}). Experiencing a high-quality system in a relatively low-income 
city, such as Quito, Ecuador, also shows city officials that a system is possible regardless of local 
economic conditions. In many instances, the process of developing a new public transport system can seem 
quite overwhelming at the outset. Seeing systems in practice and walking through the development process 
can do much to dispel uncertainties and fears. At the same time, care should be exercised to avoid giving 
the impression that project implementation is always easy, fast, and problem free.

staff in Guadalajara, Mexico.}{ Carlosfelipe Pardo.}

Surprisingly, political officials and even municipal technical staff can be relatively unfamiliar with 
public transport in their own city. Given the background and income levels of such persons, many will 
utilize their own private vehicles for transport. In the case of top elected officials, their only view 
of daily transport issues may be from the back of a chauffeur-driven luxury vehicle (\ref{figure:image7}). Thus, 
public transport systems are frequently conceptualized and designed by individuals with little actual 
familiarity with the daily realities of public transport. 

\figure{assets/image7.jpeg}{The only perspective many decision makers have on 
transport is based on a chauffeur-driven ride to work each day.}{ Lloyd Wright.}

Organizing a tour of the public transport conditions in an official’s own city can be an eye-opening 
experience for the official. In cities such as Bogotá, Delhi, Johannesburg, and São Paulo, officials 
have either made a point to regularly utilize public transport and/or have required staff to use public 
transport for certain periods of time (\rangeref{figure:image8}{figure:image9}).

\figure{assets/image8.jpeg}{Leading political officials, such as former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa of

Testimonials from one political official to another may sometimes be appropriate. Visits to cities 
by prominent former mayors such as Enrique Peñalosa and Jaime Lerner have been sponsored by international 
organizations to help catalyze local actions. Showing how mayors and governors who delivered high-quality 
systems have tended to win subsequent elections can also be quite motivating to local officials.

Advances in information and communications technologies (ICT) have put the power of sophisticated visual 
and software tools in the hands of most municipalities. Visual renderings of stations, vehicles, and 
runways can do much to excite political officials over the possibilities (\ref{figure:image10}). Videos of high-quality 
public transport systems in cities such as Bogotá, Colombia; Brisbane, Australia; and Curitiba, Brazil 
provide an accurate visual display of the options to decision makers. Likewise, digital video technology 
is now available to simulate how a new system would actually operate in a city of interest. Being able 
to “virtually ride” the new system at an early stage in the planning process cannot only work to stimulate 
political commitment but it can also help planning staff with design considerations. In a similar manner, 
small models of vehicles, stations, and runways all help give political officials a hands-on feel with 
the possibilities (\ref{figure:image11}).

\figure{assets/image11.jpeg}{Small-scale models, as shown here with a proposed 
terminal facility in Quito help give decision makers a three-dimensional understanding of the physical 
infrastructure.}{ Lloyd Wright.}

A pre-feasibility study is also an effective mechanism to build initial interest in public transport 
improvement. The pre-feasibility work can include the identification of major corridors for public transport 
development, early estimates of potential benefits (economic, environmental, social, etc.), and approximations 
of expected costs. This work will be fairly superficial, but will at least give decision makers a degree 
of confidence in a possible project direction. The faster and more compelling this early vision of the 
new system, the easier it will be for decision makers to build the necessary political commitment to 
move forward. This early vision will be needed to persuade the public and interested parties to support 
the project, and to guide the information-gathering process. 

The techniques for achieving project commitment are varied, and can depend greatly on the local context, 
but the principal aim is to get the chief decision maker to make a public commitment to implementing 
a major transformation of the public transport system, and to create a sense of expectation among members 
of the public.
