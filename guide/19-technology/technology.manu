Information technology (IT) systems are an important component of high-quality BRT systems. BRT services
are designed to cater to large passenger volumes and must deliver fast, accurate, and reliable services
in the form of financial transactions, customer information, and operations systems. IT systems address
the complexities of day-to-day operations management, reducing manpower and contributing to sizable cost
savings. Over the years, the level of integration has increased so that IT now takes a system-oriented
approach. IT can be leveraged to foster cooperation among the various transport modes and coordinate
management of mobility systems. This chapter provides broad guidance on the planning, implementation,
and operations of IT systems. For a more comprehensive guide to IT systems for BRT and bus systems, refer
to the World Bank Toolkit on Intelligent Transport Systems.

\begintable{Key IT System Functions}
\header \' TODO: Fix this '\
\col *Operations Monitoring*
\col \item Ensures on-time performance by facilitating information sharing among the control center, stations, and buses;\item Documents system operations for determining compensation for the bus operator.\item Generates data that can be used to improve service efficiency and system performance.
\row
\col *Customer Information*
\col \item In stations, the IT system informs passengers of upcoming departure times and destinations;\item On buses, electronic displays indicate the destination;\item In buses, the IT system informs passengers of upcoming stop names and transfer opportunities;\item Emergency notifications.
\row
\col *Fare Collection*
\col \item Records sales, payment collection, and system usage;\item Provides opportunities to integrate fare payment mechanism across multiple transport modes.
\row
\col *Signal Control*
\col \item Facilitates efficient junction management and signal priority for buses.
\row
\col *Fleet Management*
\col \item Manages manpower and allocates duties;\item Schedules maintenance.;
\row
\col *Surveillance Systems*
\col \item Ensures station security.
