> All of the biggest technological inventions created by man—the airplane, the automobile, the computer—says little about his intelligence, but speaks volumes about his laziness.

The management information system (MIS) uses data from the AVM and fare collection systems to generate 
information to aid in optimizing planning and service. The information generated can support a wide range 
of planning, analysis, reporting, and administrative functions. This includes service planning, scheduling, 
resource optimization, performance, and contract management. The MIS helps identify loopholes and deficiencies 
in the system and make quick decisions to address any shortcomings. 

The IT service provider can develop a graphic dashboard that provides real-time output pertaining to 
bus operations and financial transactions. For example, the dashboard can have different modules and 
tab functions to show summaries of real-time passenger boarding at various stations, tickets issued, 
buses in operation, bus positions, and bus speeds. There can be many different types of output reports 
generated for personnel at different levels of management. The reports can be provided on a daily, weekly, 
and monthly basis.
