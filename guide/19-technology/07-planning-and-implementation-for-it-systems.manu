\subsection{ Feasibility Study}

For any proposed IT investment, it is strongly recommended to carry out an in-depth feasibility study 
of the system to be implemented. The feasibility study is the opportunity to specify the functional requirements 
and objectives to be achieved. The feasibility study is also an opportunity for all internal and external 
stakeholders to understand the ITS and its long-term potential. The study must also define the milestones 
and expected outcomes at each stage of the end of implementation. It will also facilitate the planning 
and management of the implementation process, within the specified budget constraints and deadlines. 


The feasibility report should include the following components:

\item Context analysis: service typology and dimensions;
\item Identification of the actors involved;
\item Functional, technical, and operational specifications for each component and subsystem;
\item Technological infrastructure analysis, exiting network performance and coverage, and existing devices, 
software, and databases with which the IT system to be implemented will be integrated;
\item Implementation plan;
\item Maintenance process and related operational procedures;
\item Investment/operational costs and benefits;
\item Modalities for the purchasing of the system (service or direct investments), possible cofinancing sources;
\item Performance and quality gains, including ridership and revenue gains;
\item Data generation and ancillary system support;
\item Corporate capacity;
\item Risk assessment;
\item Legal requirements of ITS solutions/technologies (i.e., communication technologies and related laws).

The feasibility study should enable the leaders/owners of the BRT agency to make a sound business decision 
on whether to proceed with the IT investment, with a reasonable understanding of the system capacity, 
anticipated benefits, investment and lifecycle costs, and implementation risks. It should provide the 
implementers with sufficient guidance to proceed to detailed design.
