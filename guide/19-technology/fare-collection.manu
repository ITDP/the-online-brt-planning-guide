IT systems for fare collection handle revenue management, financial management systems, and automatic 
fare collection (AFC). BRT systems function well with off-board, automatic fare collection systems, which 
reduce vehicle boarding times, allow the rapid introduction of new tariffs and services, reduce revenue 
leakage, provide data to support system optimization, and support integrated ticketing across multiple 
modes. Fare collection consists essentially of revenue management processes. The income received by the 
BRT agency and its expenses are managed by IT systems. 

BRT stations have fare collection cabins where passengers may recharge electronic fare-payment media 
or purchase single-ride media. Passengers are able to use smart cards or other payment media at access 
control barriers inside the stations. These devices read the payment medium, determine if the medium 
has sufficient value, and then deduct the appropriate fare. The fare payment data are transmitted to 
the CCC via the station server. 

The AFC system may be integrated with payment mechanisms on feeder buses and other non-BRT buses. Passengers 
use electronic media or buy tickets from conductors using handheld ticketing machines. At the end of 
a shift, the information is downloaded to a terminal server, where it is transmitted to CCC.

Data from all AFC transactions are stored at the CCC. Authorized BRT agency staff can view the financial 
transaction data through a secure dashboard developed by the IT service provider. The BRT agency can 
use the output from the AFC system to monitor financial performance on a continual basis. The BRT agency 
and an IT service provider may jointly staff the CCC. Cash collection from stations and terminals can 
be the responsibility of a service provider or bank. The service provider issues a daily report on total 
cash collection, and the bank issues a daily deposit report to the BRT agency.
