\quotation{A truthful evaluation of yourself gives feedback for growth and success.}

Continuous monitoring of the IT deployment is required to ensure that the bidder adheres to prescribed 
quality and standards and provides the materials that are agreed as per contract. Monitoring and evaluation 
can be jointly carried out by the IT team and project management firm as a third party inspection. In 
order to ensure that the service provider adheres to required service standards and delivers quality 
output, the implementing agency should select performance indicators and include corresponding benchmarks 
in the IT operator contract(s). Some examples of performance indicators and desired service levels are 
presented in Table 19.7. For a full description of performance 
indicators, see the World Bank's document, “ITS Toolkit for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) for urban 
passenger transport”.

Several bodies have worked toward creating standards for IT systems:
\item In the USA, the National ITS Architecture is published at . This website also contains detailed 
technical information and guidance on how to use it; 
\item In Europe, the ITS System Architecture is called FRAME (\url{http://www.frame-online.net/node/38}).

Communication protocols: 
\item TPEG for transmission of language independent multimodal travel and traffic information systems, 
from the format/technical solution to exchange data;
\item DATEX/DATEXII for traffic data, RDS-TMC over radio communication;
\item SIRI in the domain of public transport; 
\item WFS/WMS specifications, xml protocol, etc.;
\item Location referencing (AGORA-C, OpenGIS standard, etc.).
