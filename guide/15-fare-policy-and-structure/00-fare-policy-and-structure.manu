Defining fare policies can be a tricky subject. There must be an adequate balance between the technical
and political aspects that may come into play when defining them. It is often the case that mayors have
the authority to define public transport fares but do not necessarily consider all the technical aspects
related to such an important decision.

The fare policies must take into account issues such as:

\item Will the system receive subsidies or will it generate profit?
\item If the system is profitable, what will be done with this profit?
\item Will there be discounted fares for population groups (seniors, students, etc.), either now or
in the future?
\item How will the system be affected by political climate change in the future?
\item Who are the system’s stakeholders, and which of those will receive payment and how (i.e., vehicle
operating companies, feeder operators, security and maintenance providers, fare collection operator,
BRT authority, trust fund manager, others)?

Since each case is different, every city should develop its own set of questions before implementing
a fare policy, always taking into account that this is the decision that will probably affect users the
most.

Once the questions are answered, implementers must do an analysis of all the possible costs and revenue
sources of the system. This will allow cities to have a more precise idea of what the “fair fare” should
be and allow them to start considering possible financing sources, such as private or public investment.

In the following sections, we will discuss objectives, techniques, and points to consider when deciding
on a fare policy for a BRT system.
