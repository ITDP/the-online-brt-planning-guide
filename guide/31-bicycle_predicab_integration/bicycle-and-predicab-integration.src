\chapter{Bicycle and Predicab Integration}



> When man invented the bicycle, he reached the peak of his attainments. Here was a machine of precision 
and balance for the convenience of man. And (unlike subsequent inventions for man’s convenience) the 
more he used it, the fitter his body became. Here, for once, was a product of man’s brain that was entirely 
beneficial to those who used it, and of no harm or irritation to others. Progress should have stopped 
when man invented the bicycle.

*Overview*


This chapter covers the integration of bicycles and pedicabs into a BRT system. Bicycles and pedicabs 
are useful vehicles for expanding the reach of BRT. Whether privately or publicly owned, they serve an 
important link in the trip chain. Every traveller makes a series of mental calculations based on time, 
available modes, costs, and familiarity with different modes. There are certain distances where it is 
more time- and cost-effective for cyclists to continue to their destinations without using public transport. 
A complete system of bicycle infrastructure and parking allows for the individual to make the best decision.
