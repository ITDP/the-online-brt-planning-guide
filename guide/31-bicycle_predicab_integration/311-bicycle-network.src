> Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.

This section discusses the general planning elements for a bicycle network, and how it fits within 
the overall public transport network. 

\subsection{Trip Chains}

Virtually all trips can be analyzed as a “chain of trips.” The simplest chain has three links: a walking 
trip to a vehicle, a vehicle ride, and a walking trip to one’s final destination. For those lucky enough 
to be able to store their bikes in their homes and offices, the journey may consist entirely of one mode: 
the bike.

The trip-chain concept is of utmost importance when thinking about public transport. All public transport 
users have to travel from their origin to the public transport stop, and at the end of the trip from 
the public transport stop to their destination. This means that “access” and “egress” trips are an integral 
part of public transport travel. These “feed” the transport system, and are referred to as feeder trips. 
Given its complementary characteristics, cycling is an excellent feeder mode.

An integrated public transport system allows users to ride their bicycles from their home to the nearest 
public transport station, and then take public transport to their final destination (by leaving their 
bicycle at the station or taking it with them on the public transport vehicle). When multi-modal connections 
are well implemented, travel times become similar to or better than those of a private car, especially 
in big cities with congestion and less provision for parked cars. Above all, travel times improve when 
public transport enjoys segregated express routes (e.g., in BRT or rail systems), and can travel congestion 
free. A transport policy that includes as wide a range of multimodal (or intermodal) trip opportunities 
as possible can increase public transport ridership, while increasing access for all transport users.

\subsubsection{Integrating Bicycles into the Trip Chain}

The following lists precise points in the trip chain that benefit most from bicycle integration:
\item To/from the public transport station: Bicycles should be available to serve people whose point 
of origin or final destination is too far from the public transport station for them to complete their 
trip on foot. In some cities, users keep a second bicycle parked at the egress station, but this is not 
normally the case, particularly in developing cities. Three services to meet this need include:
\item Rental bicycles: Bicycles that are managed by a specific company and are rented and returned to 
the same location, mostly for tourist purposes;
\item Shared bicycles: An important form of public transport, shared bicycles allow for trips linked 
to public transport and increased public transport range and are similar to rental bicycles, but organized 
on a larger scale. Kiosks or stations are located throughout the city to allow users to circulate shared 
bicycles. Often rented for short periods of time through a membership system, bike-share serves both 
tourists and commuters;
\item Bicycle taxis (pedicabs): Three-wheeled human-powered vehicles that operate as feeders to public 
transport; 
\item At the public transport station:
\item Bike parking: The provision of ample, secure bicycle parking facilities near or in public transport 
stations;
\item Bike stations: Enhanced bicycle facilities in key locations with various services, used as a multimodal 
transfer station. Services may include key card access bike parking, locker rooms, showers, rental, and 
retail facilities;
\item During the public transport ride:
\item Bikes on buses: Provision of bicycle racks on the front of or within buses, where public transport 
relies mostly on bus-based systems;
\item Bikes on rail systems: Provision of space and permission to enter rail vehicles in specific times 
and locations, for large cities with rail-based systems.

\subsubsection{Minimizing Delay and Transfers}

When deciding whether and how to make a trip, people make a number of calculations based on time, ease, 
price, and familiarity. Delays and transfers increase trip time. Predicting and calculating these points 
of delay is an important part of structuring an overall journey, whether by the consumer or public transport 
operator. The critical element usually is the amount of delay at each transfer. If the public transport 
service is very frequent, wait time will be minimized. If finding bike parking is time-consuming, then 
the transfer can be longer. As shown in the graphic below, the time to ride a bike from origin to destination 
might be equal to the same journey involving transfers, especially for short trips.

\subsubsection{The Bicycle’s Part in Modal Integration}

The success of any public transport system depends on modal integration. A driving network extends 
from one’s origin (garage) to one’s destination (parking) with an entire complement of integrated roadways: 
driveways, access lanes, highways, and so on. Likewise, a public transport network should extend from 
origin to destination. The bicycle can be an integral part in this network as it extends and augments 
the public transport network; the ability to use a bicycle can be the deciding factor in whether one 
takes public transport or chooses to drive alone.

\subsection{Catchment Area}

overlaid on stations along the Insurgentes BRT line in Mexico City.}{ Google Earth.}

Cycling exponentially increases the catchment area of a BRT station. As shown in Figure 31.4, one can 
walk about 800 meters in 10 minutes, assuming a 4.8-kph pace. Ten minutes is generally used as the amount 
of time that one will travel to access high-quality public transport (BRT, metro, ferry). Cycling at 
15 kilometers per hour (kph) yields a range of 2.5 kilometers in the same amount of time. Fifteen kph 
is known as a “no sweat” pace—a speed that will allow you to arrive dry. While the cycling distance is 
just over three times that of walking, the catchment area is twenty-five times greater. Figure 31.2 applies 
these catchment areas to the Insurgentes BRT line in Mexico City. 

The bicycle-catchment area expands the longer patrons are willing to ride to the BRT station. This 
is important in lower-density areas, or in areas constrained by geography. A catchment area based on 
a 60-minute ride is 15 kilometers in radius. This could cover a large part of an urban area. Thirty minutes 
(7.5-kilometer radius) is the general limit for a normal catchment area.

\subsubsection{Integrating Bicycles with BRT}

The benefits of integrating bicycles into the BRT system include:
\item Door-to-door service, competitive with private vehicles;
\item Larger station-catchment areas (see Section 31.1.2), which increase ridership potential;
\item Low-cost system expansion (bicycles used instead of feeder buses);
\item Reduced pressure on congested roads and auto parking (trips shift to bicycle);
\item Less delay, because patrons do not need to wait for feeder buses.

Key initiatives to improve cycling-BRT integration include:
\item Seamless bicycle-route connections to BRT stations;
\item Smooth transfers between bicycles and the BRT system;
\item Secure parking facilities for bicycles at BRT stations;
\item Bike rentals or public bicycle services;
\item Pedicabs (bicycle taxis).

\subsection{Using Bikes to Augment BRT}

Typically, bicycles have been used to expand the reach of BRT; however, bicycles can also be used to 
augment service. For example, if BRT station spacing is based on a cycling catchment area (2.5 kilometers) 
instead of a walking catchment area (800 meters), fewer stations or skip-stop service are required. With 
fewer stops, travel time on the vehicle is reduced. Those fewer stations can be more highly developed, 
with bike parking and so forth. This scenario has been proposed in the Netherlands, where the highly 
developed bicycle infrastructure makes it feasible. 

Bicycles can augment BRT via recreational trips on the weekends and during off-peak hours. Often the 
system will have excess capacity during these times, which can be used to travel to the outskirts of 
the city and ride a bike in the country, for example.

Bicycles can help distribute journeys more evenly throughout the system. For instance, patrons arriving 
by foot typically walk to the nearest station, even though it may be small, crowded, or not an express 
stop. By bike, one has a greater choice of stations. Thus, one can choose an express stop, a station 
on a different line (thereby avoiding a transfer), or a station that is less crowded. This may relieve 
pressure on overloaded segments and add customers on underused stretches. 

\subsection{ Complementary BRT and Bicycle Networks}

Traditionally, public transport and bicycle networks have been developed and operated separately. In 
many cases, they were seen as competitors; public transport operators feared that cycling would steal 
patrons, and vice versa. This is parallel to the animosity between public transport and driving systems. 

Some of the more recently successful BRT systems have taken a different approach. They see cycling 
as complementary and have sought to develop complementary systems. The basic idea is: It is not possible 
to provide high-quality public transport service to every part of the city, so bicycles fill in the gaps. 
Thus, the combination of a BRT system with a bike-lane network can do much to provide citywide mobility 
and improved access for users. For example, Bogotá is home to Latin America’s largest bicycle network 
with some 320 kilometers of dedicated bike lanes. Ultimately, if one can move throughout a city without 
a car, then one will not need a car.

Techniques to merge BRT and bicycle systems include:
\item Place bicycle facilities on higher-volume, higher-speed roads that lead to the BRT corridor. This 
will “collect” cyclists and deposit them at the BRT stations;
\item Locate BRT stations along existing high-usage bicycle routes, such as greenways. This will allow 
cyclists to ride to the stations, or ride to a different BRT line;
\item Upgrade the cycling infrastructure within 2.5 kilometers of BRT stations (discussed in Section 
31.3.1 of this chapter).

\subsection{ Bicycles Onboard BRT}

The viability of permitting bicycles to be brought on board the BRT vehicle depends on the level of 
crowding in the system, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7: Capacity and Speed. In general, 
folding bikes should be allowed on board at all times, in much the same way that luggage is. It may be 
prudent to require a bag, or that the bike be placed in a luggage hold. Some BRT systems, such as AC 
Transit serving the East Bay of California, USA, and C-TRAN in Vancouver, Canada, permit bicycles to 
be brought on board during nonpeak hours. There might be a requirement to board only certain cars (the 
first or last) or through certain doors. Some systems require a permit or extra fee; however, if the 
intention is to encourage cycling this might be counter-productive. Most important, the requirements 
for bikes on board need to be clear and consistent. For example, if the number of bikes on each vehicle 
is limited, a cyclist runs the risk of being denied entry, which leads to travel delays. Uncertainty 
tempers use.
