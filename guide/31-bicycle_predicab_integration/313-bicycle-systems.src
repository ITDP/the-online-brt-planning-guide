This section provides an overview of bike-share (public bikes) and pedicab systems. These systems allow 
people to derive the benefits of cycling without bike ownership or maintenance. 

*Bike-Share*

Bike-share systems consist of a fleet of bicycles available on demand at a network of stations throughout 
a designated service area. Users pick up and drop off bicycles at their convenience. When integrated 
into public transport, bike-share extends the reach of public transport and provides a “last-mile” solution 
to and from destinations that are beyond walking distance of the station. ITDP’s *Bike-Share Planning 
Guide*, released in 2013, provides detailed guidance on how to plan and implement a successful bike-share 
system.

Cities throughout the world are investing in bike-share as a relatively inexpensive and quickly implemented 
urban transportation option. Modern bike-share systems are characterized by providing subscription-based 
service, to ensure user identification and accountability against theft and vandalism. Subscribers unlock 
bicycles using smart cards or RFID keys, while walk-up users sign up with a credit card at a station 
or kiosk. To encourage short trips, users are charged a flat rate for thirty to sixty minutes of use, 
after which progressively higher fees are charged. Technology integration with bike-share systems often 
provides access to wayfinding information and station maps, including currently available bicycles and 
docks.

\subsection{ System Type }

There are two basic bike-share system models: fixed and flexible programs. Fixed programs include docking 
stations where users can check out a bicycle at a known, fixed location. Flexible programs rely on existing 
bicycle racks throughout the service area. 

*Fixed Programs*

Stations may be fully automated, allowing users to unlock a bicycle with a RFID card or key, linking 
the bicycle to the user’s account and recording when the bicycle was taken and returned. A kiosk at the 
station transmits data between the dock and control center to: 
\item Report the number of bicycles at the station;
\item Record users taking out bicycles and returning them;
\item Provide information to users about their subscription account;
\item Process credit cards for walk-up users;
\item Provide the location and capacity of nearby stations.

Stationary docking stations can be permanent or modular. Permanent stations are installed into the 
ground, hardwired to utilities, and not movable. Modular stations are less expensive to install because 
they require little or no excavation. Modular stations can be adjusted more easily, adding or removing 
docks to accommodate user demand, events, and construction sites. The Bixi system in Montreal uses modular 
bike-share stations to allow the system to be removed during winter months, when demand is lower. Modular 
stations often rely on a combination of solar power and batteries, which increases the flexibility of 
station siting, as placement is not dependent on utility connections.

In some scenarios, station attendants are warranted. Large stations that have capacity or high turnover, 
and stations near tourist destinations that attract many casual and unfamiliar users, can warrant having 
attendants to assist with redistribution and customer service. At high-demand bike-share stations at 
BRT stations in Guangzhou, China, an overflow corral is managed by an attendant, who moves bicycles from 
docks to the corral, or replenishes the docks with the corralled bicycles.

*Flexible Programs*

Flexible bike-share systems do not use stations, instead relying on a smart-lock system that utilizes 
GPS and wireless communications to communicate with the system control center. The security and checkout 
infrastructure is located on each bicycle, eliminating the need for kiosks or docking stations. The smart-lock 
handles check-in and check-out functions, transmits the usage and location of each bicycle as needed, 
and monitors maintenance needs and unauthorized use. Users typically preregister online, use a system 
map to locate a nearby bicycle, and check it out using a text message or mobile phone app. Without docking 
stations, the cost of a flexible bike-share system is greatly reduced. Compared to fixed systems, flexible 
systems can make bike-share travel between public transport and lower-demand destinations affordable 
and feasible, because docking stations are not required near every destination.

\subsection{Service Area and Phasing}

The coverage, or service area, of a bike-share system is typically determined based on areas that will 
generate the most users or serve a need for improved mobility. Factors in the development of the service 
area typically include the locations where people live, work, shop, play, and access public transport. 
In addition, social and geographic equity concerns are often considered on the basis of serving areas 
with low household income, low mobility, and poor access to public transport, among other factors. 

To maximize success, bike-share systems often launch in phases, starting in areas with the highest 
demand to accelerate success of the system. The decision to expand beyond the first phase (and subsequent 
phases) will depend on available funding and the success of the system. System success is typically measured 
in terms of visible achievements, such as high ridership, positive public response, neighborhood and 
corporate requests for service-area expansion, and ongoing financial performance. Essentially, the system 
will grow if the expansion can be sustained through existing funding or an additional influx of user 
fees, private sponsorship, grants, and/or public funding.

Rollout should occur in manageable stages that match funding and organizational capacity. Later phases 
may introduce service to communities that are discontinuous from earlier phases, but will generate their 
own demand and provide a connection to public transport for longer trips. The Guangzhou, China, bike-share 
system opened in June 2010 with 18 stations and 1,000 bicycles along the Zhongshan Avenue BRT corridor. 
Over three phases, the system grew to include 15,000 bicycles around BRT stations and connect nearby 
residential and commercial areas. 

*Service Levels*

The operator of a bike-share system should adhere to service levels that ensure an efficient and quality 
experience for the user, including:
\item Maximum time periods the system or any part of it can be out of operation;
\item Constant availability of bicycles and open docks to return bicycles to stations;
\item Cleaning and maintenance schedule of the various aspects of the system; 
\item Longest time period faults are accepted and repairs can take.

Service levels can be enforced by both monetary penalties and rewards, with monitoring of service levels 
through the IT system. Both the operator and the government-oversight body should have access to the 
information database. If properly designed, this access by both parties allows for the service-level 
standards to become shared knowledge, so there are no discrepancies between the two organizations about 
the payment.

*Station Density*

The size of a bike-share system is a function of its service area and the desired spacing of stations. 
Successful bike-share systems rely on a high density of stations within the service area, to minimize 
the distances users must walk to pick up or drop off a bicycle near their final destination. The Vélib 
system in Paris places approximately ten stations per square kilometer, or approximately one station 
every 300 meters. On average, station spacing in European and North American bike-share systems is typically 
between 300 and 400 meters, with a station density of approximately six to ten stations per square kilometer. 
This range provides access to a bike within a short walk of anywhere in the service area, and provides 
a nearby alternative to return a bike if the destination station is full.

*Station Size*

Station size is a function of demand. It is important that there be sufficient empty docks for riders 
to return bikes. Bike-share systems in Europe and North America typically use a ratio of 1.5 to 2 docks 
per bicycle to allow high-demand areas to accommodate peak period travel patterns. In an optimized system, 
the bicycles are used six to nine times a day. Higher ratios of docks increase capital costs, while lower 
ratios of docks to bicycles generally result in higher rebalancing costs. Redistribution vehicles and 
associated personnel can help balance full destination stations by restocking empty stations with high 
checkouts. Redistribution is one of the greatest challenges in operating a bike-share system. Using electric 
vehicles to transport bicycles and offering free time and incentives to return the bicycles to low-demand 
stations are two ways that Vyste, in Paris, optimized its redistribution process to reduce costs and 
minimize environmental impacts.

*Station Placement*

Based on the target density or distance a user must walk, stations are sited throughout the service 
area near bicycle infrastructure, public transport, and other key destinations. Bike-share stations should 
be placed in safe, convenient, and highly visible locations. If stations are intended to serve a public 
transport station or hub, there should be clear sight lines between the entrance of the public transport 
station and the bike-share station. Bike-share stations should ideally be located a short distance from 
BRT stations, without obstructing pedestrian and vehicle circulation, or forcing users to cross streets. 
This creates seamless transfers for the user from one mode of public transport to another. BRT station 
design can facilitate unique integration of bike-share stations. Unused space under pedestrian overpasses 
and on medians created by the station platforms can offer good areas for a bike-share station.

\subsection{ Bicycle Design}

The physical design of the bicycle will depend on environmental and social norms of bicycling in the 
service area. Common attributes of successful bike-share systems include: 
\item Bicycle-frame design that accommodates users of varying sizes, such as a step-through design, 
which can be easily mounted. Adjustable seats that can be raised or lowered for different-sized users; 

\item Concealed drive trains and cables to minimize wear and tampering;
\item A front basket or rack to carry a bag, rather than a rear rack, which can be overloaded or improperly 
used to carry passengers. Front and rear reflectors and lights, usually powered by a dynamo attached 
to the wheel, for visibility and compliance with local laws;
\item Fenders to keep users dry in the rain. Bicycles that are identical and constructed of customized 
components to limit their appeal to theft and vandalism. The availability of those spares should be written 
into the procurement contracts with suppliers.

31.3.4 Integration with BRT

*Information Integration*

Signage that shows transfers from bike-share to BRT expands the reach of the public transport network. 
Real-time information, including timetables, station location, capacity, and operating hours can be available 
to the user through information management systems (website, on-screen display, and smartphone apps), 
signage, and user service personnel. Maps and routing applications, which help plot origin and destination 
trips using BRT, bike-share, and other modes of public transport, allow users to plan multimodal trips 
effectively. 

*Payment Integration*

Payment integration is an important means of creating an integrated public transport system. The same 
smart card that is used for BRT should also be used for the bike-share system and other forms of public 
transport. A single, integrated payment system that allows users to access BRT for longer distances and 
bike sharing for the “last mile” provides the experience of a unified public-transport system, even if 
payments are dispersed to various operators from a control center. The Navigo pass in Paris allows users 
access to Vélib bike-share, subway, and regional trains. 

*Case Study: Guangzhou, China*

In Guangzhou the bike-share system was implemented and opened as part of the BRT project. Launched 
in June 2010, the Chinese city of Guangzhou inaugurated a bike-share system with 5,000 bicycles and 110 
stations in the Tianhe District to complement the BRT, as well as the bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure 
along the corridor. A portion of the BRT trunk line acted as a backbone for the identified coverage area 
for Phase 1 of the system (Tianhe District), and the capital costs of the Phase 1 system were included 
in the overall BRT budget. The company operating the public bike system is owned by the same government 
agency that owns the company regulating the BRT operations, which is also in charge of regulating bus 
stops and bus terminals throughout Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Public Bicycle System has approximately 35,000 
users and 21,000 rides per day, with one-third of users making trips by bike-share more than seven times 
per week.

*Pedicabs (Bicycle Taxis)*

A pedicab (also known as a *cycle rickshaw*, *becak*, *velotaxi*, *trisikad*, *sanlunche*, or *trishaw*) 
provides low-cost, nonpolluting mobility while serving as an important source of employment in cities 
around the world. Pedicabs generally have three wheels and are manually powered. They are an ideal feeder 
service to BRT stations, especially for trips of 4 kilometers or less, and on streets that are too narrow 
for buses. They can be organized as a formal component of the BRT system, or encouraged informally through 
incentives. Finally, a system of pedicabs is an ideal tool to encourage entrepreneurship.

\subsection{ Pedicab Design}

Similar to the regular bicycle, the design of pedicabs has advanced in recent years. Newer models are 
lighter, stronger, faster, and more comfortable than their earlier counterparts. In selecting a standard 
pedicab to complement a BRT system, every effort should be made to choose the most recent model and continue 
to update the models annually. This includes features such as customer shading systems, aerodynamic profiles, 
and advanced suspension, braking, and gearing systems.

*Case Study: Agra, India*

In the late 1990s, ITDP and several local partners initiated a program to develop a modernized cycle 
rickshaw for the Indian market. The initiative was launched in Agra, India, and quickly spread to other 
cities, including Delhi. The project produced a rickshaw that weighs 30 percent less than traditional 
rickshaws, at roughly the same cost (Figure 31.60). Drivers reported a 50 percent increase in earnings, 
because they could ply the modern rickshaw for a longer period of time and also due to superior comfort 
for customers. Today, over 300,000 modern pedicabs operate on the streets of Indian cities. In Indonesia, 
cities such as Yogyakarta are following the lead of the Indian cities and producing a modernized pedicab 
(Figure 31.63).

\subsection{ Facilities}

*Additional Width*

Because they are wider than a bicycle, there are special concerns for pedicabs in facility design. 
Ideally they should use the non-motorized roadway network, such as greenways, bike lanes, low-speed streets, 
or alleys. These facilities should be designed accordingly. A more spacious design also accommodates 
bike trailers, wagons, adult tricycles, and other nonstandard bikes. Note that there are varying vehicle 
widths, thus the dimensions below need to be verified for each country. Some general guidelines for pedicab 
facilities are:
\item Pedicabs generally fit in a 1.5-meter-wide bike lane, but not narrower; 1.8 meters is preferred;
\item Bicycles and pedicabs need to pass each other. In a striped lane this is accomplished by moving 
into the adjacent auto lane. A bike lane should be at least 2 meters wide, if not 2.5 meters;
\item Bollards and other obstacles that allow a bicycle to pass through may restrict a pedicab. A 1.7-meter 
clearance generally does not restrict a pedicab;
\item Ramps designed for bicycles need to be wider for pedicabs;
\item Parking facilities need to be larger to accommodate pedicabs.

*Waiting Stands at BRT Stations*

Whether formal or informal, waiting stands at BRT stations are integral to integrating pedicabs and 
BRT. It is here that drivers wait for customers, rest, and service their vehicles. These facilities are 
not unlike the bike stations described above and may be operated as a concession. Fundamental features 
include:
\item Waiting areas for drivers;
\item Toilet and washroom facilities;
\item Bike washing;
\item Basic maintenance, such as minor adjustments and air for tires.

The waiting stands should be situated near customer egress points, but not so close as to cause congestion. 
They should be within eyesight of patrons. Ideally they would be located closer than the MV taxi stand. 
It is best to separate them from bicycle parking and lockers.

\subsection{ Regulations}

Unfortunately, many countries and cities took steps to reduce pedicabs during the latter part of the 
twentieth century. As such, there may be regulations that need to be altered as well as a lack of safety, 
pricing, and other standards. In any for-hire service, standardization is a good business practice. Key 
regulations to consider include:
\item Posted fare information;
\item Regular pricing schemes, either via a meter or zone. Licensing and registration of pedicabs to 
ensure a minimum vehicle condition, tire quality, and functional brakes; 
\item Permission for pedicabs to use both motorized and non-motorized facilities.

\subsection{ Operations}

Formal operating structures can deliver enhanced customer service while improving working conditions 
for pedicab drivers. The experience in many places is of a hectic, informal pedicab queue at public transport 
stations. Should the drivers be organized, this disorderly system can be regularized, which makes for 
a more pleasant customer experience. A formal system includes driver training, uniforms, and unionization.

New technologies that improve the user experience and increase the efficiency of the service can be 
encouraged. As smartphone use spreads throughout the world, it is possible to integrate a smartphone 
app that connects to pedicab operators. 

*Case Study: Fazilka, India*

In the town of Fazilka in northern India, the Ecocabs system provides a dial-a-rickshaw service for 
local residents. After a customer places a call, a cycle rickshaw is dispatched to the customer’s address 
within minutes. The system features a network of driver facilities with food service, restrooms, and 
other amenities. Participating drivers can avail themselves of low-cost loans for vehicle purchase, medical 
and accident insurance, educational allowances for their children, and other benefits. The system also 
has a mechanism for handling customer grievances.
