\section{Stations and Terminals}

\quotation{I think about non-visual design, which comes from my experience, but also from a general critique of architecture. It’s so much about how things look. I’m interested in how a building is experienced when you touch it with your hand, when you grab a railing or lean into an atrium.}
{Chris Downey, architect, planner, and consultant}

This section presents universal access features of BRT stations and terminals.

\subsection{Station Personnel}

\figure{assets/image30.jpeg}{A station attendant in a TransMilenio station. Image}{TransMilenio.}

It is important to train BRT staff to be respectful and courteous to patrons with disabilities. While
many will need no assistance, some will need help with fare payment, route information, navigation (e.g.,
to elevators and wide fare gates), and passage through turnstiles. The presence of uniformed staff and
security personnel makes BRT more appealing to persons with disabilities. This is especially true at
night, when such customers may be hesitant to travel.

\subsection{Fare Payment}

\subsubsection{Fare Cards}

Prepaid proximity cards (contactless cards) require less hand dexterity and benefit persons with limited
mobility. The option of purchasing multiple trips may also reduce stress for persons with disabilities.
However, disability correlates with poverty, and the problem of poor persons who cannot afford to prepay
for multiple trips needs to be recognized.

\subsubsection{Fare-Card Vending Sites}

A low counter, to serve wheelchair users and short persons, should ideally be included at neighborhood
fare card vending locations and should be a feature of formal BRT facilities. An accessible counter or
ticket vending window should be:

\item 800 millimeters high, ideally with knee space for a wheelchair user;
\item At least 500 millimeters deep;
\item At least 900 millimeters wide;
\item With at least 1,200 millimeters of clear space in front.

Electronic ticket vending machines should have buttons and slots for cash and for dispensing fare cards,
located not more than 1,200 millimeters above the ground. Assistance should be provided as needed to
blind customers, deaf customers, and others who may have difficulty with card-purchase procedures.

Consideration should be given to hiring disabled persons to work at fare vending sites where appropriate
space needs are met.

\subsubsection{Fare Gates}

There should be one or more wide fare gates in each station (clear width of at least 900 millimeters)
for customers using wheelchairs, walkers, or crutches.

\subsection{Mobility Features}

\subsubsection{Uniform Design}

A uniform design throughout the system assists all customers with navigation, especially those with
sensory and cognitive disabilities.

\subsubsection{Entrances and Exits}

Longer stations—especially those over 50 meters—should have entrances at each end when possible to
assist those who are unable to walk long distances, as well as all other customers. An exit should be
considered at the “far end” of such stations, even if an entrance is not possible. Exit doors require
a minimum of 900 millimeters of clear space. Manually operated doors should open easily, requiring no
more than 15 newtons of operating force.

\subsubsection{Seats and Supports}

Provide seating (benches, folding seats) in stations, especially where wait times exceed five minutes.
Back and hip supports (horizontal “perches” or “leaning rails”), about 700 millimeters high, assist customers
with hidden disabilities such as arthritis. Seats and supports should be painted a high contrast color.

Locate seats and supports where people are most likely to wait for the BRT vehicle (not in an out-of-the-way
location). Overcrowded stations present challenges to customers with special needs; locating seating
near the vehicle door addresses this. Coordinate seat location with doors reserved for those with disabilities.

\subsubsection{Station Gates to Vehicles}

\figure{assets/image33.jpeg}{Sliding doors are a feature of many BRT systems.}{ITDP}

\figure[medium]{assets/image34.jpeg}{Sliding doors are a feature of many BRT systems.}{TransMilenio}

Since the smallest platform-to-vehicle gap is usually found at the front entrance of the vehicle, this
entrance is typically designated for use by disabled persons, who also benefit from being closer to the
driver. Transparent sliding doors, activated when vehicles dock opposite the doors, enhance safety at
platform edges, especially for customers who have reduced vision. Transparent doors also facilitate visibility—that
is, to see route signs on approaching vehicles. Doors should have audible signals to assist all customers,
and especially blind persons, to know when they are opening and closing. A tactile warning strip is required
if sliding doors are not provided and platform edges are not protected.

\subsubsection{Elevators and Lifts}

\figure{assets/image35.jpeg}{If grade-separated transfers across an intersection are necessary, then
infrastructure must be available to make such transfers possible.}{Lloyd Wright.}

Ramps are preferred at regular stations because they require little maintenance and have few security
risks. At terminals, bridges, and other locations where customers must ascend multiple levels, elevators
may augment ramps. They also assist customers with reduced mobility and people carrying children or heavy
packages. Nevertheless, elevators should never be the primary mode due to maintenance issues. Escalators
are not recommended, as they have a poor maintenance history.

\subsection{Visual Elements}

\subsubsection{Lighting}

Adequate lighting is essential for those with reduced vision. It also provides more safety and security
for all customers.

\subsubsection{Signage}

Signs and the text on them need to be of a minimum size (Table 30.1). Many countries use icons and
specific colors to supplement text for route and station names, thus assisting persons with cognitive
impairments, visitors, tourists, and others who may not be able to read text. Variable signage indicating
the arrival time of the next vehicle helps those with hearing impairments.

\endtable

\subsubsection{Color Contrast}

Color contrast is useful for signage (see chart below) and for station features such as railings, turnstiles,
wide fare gates, tactile warnings at vehicle-entry gates, folding seats, and ischiatic supports. A number
of countries use “safety yellow” as the color of choice for such uses. The International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) standard 3864 specifies “safety yellow.” The standard in the United States
is “Yellow-Federal Standard #33538.”

\subsection{Audible Elements}

Audible signage assists customers with reduced vision, particularly at the opening and closing of sliding
doors. Depending on the system, announcements can be activated by GPS technology, or simply provided
by station staff.

\subsection{Tactile Elements (Braille)}

\figure[medium]{assets/image37.jpeg}{Travel information in Braille helps the sight-impaired plan and undertake
their journeys in Nagoya, Japan.}{Lloyd Wright.}

Some blind persons may benefit from raised tactile route numbers at stations. Letters are generally
20 millimeters high and raised 1 to 2 millimeters. Others may prefer Braille signage. Consult with focus
groups and advisory committees to decide.

\subsubsection{Adhesive Tactile Wayfinding}

\figure[medium]{assets/image39.jpeg}{Adhesive tactile wayfinding that utilizes a printing technique to create tactile differentiation in the pictograms and simple symbols to help users overcome visual impairments or language barriers (Cape Town, South Africa). }{HHO Africa}

Adhesive Tactile Wayfinding is a new development in signage made possible by three-dimensional printing
technology. The development of this signage was applied to the MyCiti Integrated Rapid Public Transport
(IRT) in Cape Town, South Africa.

MyCiti IRT signage and designs are supposed to encompass identification, confirmation, and directional
information that are inclusive of all IRT users. The MyCiti IRT system utilized international best practices
and standards to construct an exemplary IRT system with wayfinding and fair accessibility standards.

Illiteracy and site impairment can hinder an individual’s ability to recognize and utilize signage.
While Braille is internationally recognized, it is not widely used in South Africa. Therefore, tactile
pictograms, or raised images, include a wider group of users. These three-dimensional signs featuring
universally understandable figures can be attached to poles surrounding IRT stations using the adhesive
backs.

The wayfinding directional signs consist of the name of the MyCITI station, the distance to that specific
station, and an arrow pointing in the direction of the station. The signs are made more recognizable
by the MyCITI red branding on them. In some sections of Cape Town, tactile wayfinding systems have been
introduced, as seen in Figures 30.38 and 30.39.

\item The original adhesive panels were designed to a width of 85 millimeters and a height of 274 millimeters
to accommodate three circular images with a diameter of 82 millimeters each. The image above on the left
consists of a pictogram of a bus, a directional arrow, and a distance indicating the nearest BRT station,
all printed in contrasting colors using MyCiti branding;
\item After participants from a study viewed the design, the team decided to increase tactile distinction,
leading to more pronounced visibility, depth, and legibility;
\item The designs for tactile wayfinding were well received by the cohort participating in the study,
especially for the benefits it would have for the sight impaired;
\item Directional wayfinding signs are located within 500 meters around MyCiti stations;
\item The adhesive panels allow for wayfinding arrows to be placed facing four directions for maximum
visibility;
\item The wayfinding information is displayed in 40-millimeter white lettering or 120-millimeter symbols
on a 150-by-950-millimeter background in the contrasting blue color of MyCITI branding;
\item Up to fourteen directional wayfinding signs are placed within the area around each MyCITI station.

Because tactile wayfinding is relatively new, the design team in Cape Town is constantly looking for
feedback to improve its services. The team hopes that the design can be applied to civic amenities and
other places of public interest in the future.

\subsubsection{Terminals and Transfer Centers}

of Lima, Peru. }{Tom Rickert/AEI.}
Terminals and transfer centers can be confusing for many customers and especially those new to the
system. Customers must understand different public transport modes and different schedules. Customers
also need direction to a range of public services and commerce.
