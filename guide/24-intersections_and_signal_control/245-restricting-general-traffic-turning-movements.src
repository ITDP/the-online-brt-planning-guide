waiting area using the narrowed width of the opposite way.}{ Bruce Sutherland.}

The overall capacity of the intersection is given by the sum of the capacity of each approaching lane. 
By its turn, the capacity of each approaching lane is given by the sum of saturation flow of the lane 
multiplied by the sum of the relative green times of the phases for when the lane is active.

No matter how many phases there are on the traffic light, the sum of relative green for all vehicular 
phases with relative lost time is constant (if there were no pedestrian phases, it would be equal to 
one). The initial step to programming traffic lights is to divide this fixed amount among the phases 
with the general assumptions that (1) a movement not allowed during a given phase will block a lane and 
(2) that the saturation flow per lane is the same (for turning it can be lower): *for any given signalized 
intersection, if a phase is removed (therefore the movements of that phase are removed) and the green 
time including the approaches for the movements of the removed phase are included into another phase 
(both in the same phase), then the overall capacity of the intersection will necessarily increase.*

This is empirically clear for a user arriving in a balanced intersection, since a larger number of 
phases in a traffic light means waiting longer and having a lower share of green time.

Of course it is not interesting to create capacity for movements without demand. The following subsections 
will discuss alternatives to divert traffic in order to increase capacity by eliminating phases. We will 
see that in some cases, intersection capacity is still increased even if the demand for some eliminated 
movements, namely cross-traffic turns, are forced to pass over the intersection twice.

Widening the intersection can be of great assistance, but doing it alone rarely can achieve the same 
benefits of reducing phases from four to two. In a relatively normal situation where turning volumes 
are large enough to the point that after the intersection the straight flow can fit in one less lane 
than before the intersection (as discussed in Section 24.4.2: Minimizing the Number of Mixed-Traffic 
Lanes Away from the Intersection), it is possible to narrow the exiting section, allowing the entrance 
section of the opposite way to be broader (Figures 24.28 and 24.29); the extra width can be useful for 
mixed traffic, enhancing mixed-traffic capacity, or to allow BRT turning movements where required (see 
Section 24.6: Allowing BRT Turns).

\beginbox{Narrowing lanes}

Narrowing lanes is a recognized traffic calming measure and a possible way to increase the intersection 
approach capacity. Even though the saturation flow will be reduced in each lane, if one more lane can 
be squeezed into the stop line, capacity may increase and a better use of space for queueing may be provided.

Places where congestion is a serious issue may already have addressed regulation that allows using 
narrow measures, and, if not, public works guidelines have to be changed.

The United States Federal Highway Administration suggests that, despite the desired lane width of 3.6 
meters to maximize flow, right-of-way or pedestrian needs may dictate use of a narrower lane width; lane 
widths below 2.7 meters are not recommended for new design, but in some very constrained retrofit situations 
on low-speed roadways, lane widths as low as 2.4 meters should be considered where appropriate (Figure 
24.30).

\figure[medium]{assets/image30.png}{Lanes as narrow as 2.4 meters are an effective way to improve intersection 
capacity, as in this intersection in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA.}{Google Earth.}

\subsection{ Eliminating Intersections}

\figure{assets/image31.jpeg}{Prior to Quito’s Ecovía line, mixed-traffic vehicles were allowed to cross 
through this intersection as well as negotiate cross-traffic and curbside turns. To give priority to 
public transport, crossing straight and cross-traffic turn movements have been blocked.}{ Lloyd 
Wright.}

The extreme case of reducing phases would only allow for one phase, which would be equivalent to eliminating 
the intersection itself, clearly increasing capacity. 

Thus eliminating intersections along the busway seems at first a good idea. For median-side busways 
this can be done by simply forbidding cross traffic, while still allowing flow from the transversal street 
to join the mixed traffic in the corridor at the curbside as in Figure 24.31, providing access to the 
corridor.

The flaw in adopting such an extreme solution is that eliminating phases is based on diverting traffic 
demand in favor of the exclusive movements, so its movement can be done with other flows. Eliminating 
the movement (in this case, crossing the corridor) does not eliminate the demand for it; the movement 
has to happen somewhere else.

This measure will reduce accessibility when applied without discretion and will concentrate crossing 
demand in a few locations (Figure 24.32). Before eliminating an intersection, it is necessary to understand 
which alternative paths the demand will use to cross the corridor and compare the impacts of both situations: 
if the volumes are low or if the alternatives will not generate more delay to the BRT, then it really 
is a good idea to eliminate the intersection. Eventually, it will become necessary to create new intersections 
to split conflicting volume of one intersection into several to increase green times for the BRT.

\figure[medium]{assets/image32.png}{Closing intersections reduces accessibility, and may lead to harder to 
handle intersections. With no stations, BRT vehicles can benefit from signal coordination.}{ Elebeta.}

If there are no stations in the surrounding area, then BRT vehicles can pass through several intersections 
at once if a synchronized signal system is used (see Section 24.1.3: Traffic Signal Concepts and Section 
24.3.1 Passive Signal Priority). However, when there are stations between intersections, the BRT vehicle 
will pass through the green phase at the first intersection and then stop at the station for customer 
boarding and alighting. By the time the vehicle resumes movement toward the second intersection, the 
signal phase may have changed to red (Figure 24.33).

\figure[medium]{assets/image33.png}{Coordination for mixed traffic does not help the BRT corridor when there 
is a station between intersections. If the green time of the green wave has the same length of total 
dwell time at stations, the effect can be particularly harmful, as it increases the chances that the 
BRT vehicle’s arrival at an intersection after a station will be during the red time. }{ ITDP.}

But when intersections are too close together in order to optimize the station location relative to 
them, an assessment has to be made regarding how important the station location is for boarding and alighting 
customers, the detour forced on mixed traffic close to the station, and to what extent it hinders the 
whole BRT system due to interference between the station and the intersection. There are three options:

\number Close one of the intersections: this generates mixed-traffic detour time and higher cross volumes 
at other points that may impact the BRT corridor as well;
\number Transfer or remove the station: this increases walking time for BRT users of that station;
\number Keep station and intersections: this generates delay for all customers in the BRT that pass through 
the intersection.

Even for normal mixed traffic, having two intersections too close together will sometimes lead to problems 
of the same nature as discussed in Section 24.4.2:  Minimizing the Number of Mixed-Traffic Lanes Away 
from the Intersection and Section 24.4.3: Minimizing the Recommended Distance between the BRT Station 
and the Intersection from a Mixed-Traffic Perspective vehicles queued at one intersection will back up 
to the point where vehicles are unable to clear the previous intersection during a green phase. Equation 
24.22 below defines the calculation for the distance above which this type of conflict shall not occur.

Eq. 24.23

$$ D_{i1-i2} \geq 3 * Max(T_\text{green-i1},T_\text{green-i2}) $$

Where:
\item $$ D_\text{i1-i2} $$: Distance in meters between intersection 1 and intersection 2;
\item $$ T_\text{green-i1} $$: Green signal time in seconds at intersection 1;
\item $$ T_\text{green-i2} $$: Green signal time in seconds at intersection 2.

A mixed-traffic lane can generally handle 1,800 vehicles per hour. This quantity translates to two 
vehicles per second (3,600 seconds in an hour). When vehicles are stopped at a stoplight, the average 
amount of space they take up is 6 meters; this space includes the vehicle and some space between vehicles. 
This average vehicle distance means that for each second of time, 3 meters of vehicle-equivalents can 
be moved through the intersection. 

This distance between the intersections guarantees that there is enough space for queueing vehicles, 
so that it does not happen that the green light is open and there are vehicles stuck in the upstream 
traffic light. Proper synchronization can reduce this distance to practically zero.

*Example*

The following scenario is outlined in order to determine whether two intersections 100 meters apart 
will result in free-flow operation or in congestion:
\item D\sub{i1-i2} = 100 meters;
\item T\sub{green-i1} = 50 seconds; 
\item T\sub{green-i2} = 30 seconds.

To determine if the distance between these intersections is sufficient, Equation 24.19 can be applied:

$$ 100 \geq 2.5 * Max(50,30) $$ 

$$ 100 \geq 150 \leftarrow \text{FALSE} $$

Since 100 meters is less than the required 150 meters, there is not enough space between the intersections. 


In the direction from 1 to 2 it is possible (if 2 is red while 1 is green) that vehicles queuing at 
2 will back up onto the first intersection and the last 50 meters of queue will be trapped before intersection 
1. 

In the direction from 2 to 1 it is possible (if 1 green starts the same time the first vehicle from 
2 arrives at the intersection), then the last 20 seconds of green in 1 will be useless, since vehicles 
stop flowing after 30 seconds in intersection 2.

\subsection{ Shortening and Eliminating Phases}

In this subsection we name traffic diversion models and traffic sign phase schemes as we describe them 
in order to refer to them in the following text and in the next subsection.

\subsubsection{Typical 4-Phase-Intersection}

In a typical intersection that allows all movements (Figure 24.34), four phases are required; usually 
each origin has its phase (“standard-four-phase”) but an alternative scheme with one phase for each direction 
(two ways) in straight movement and curbside turns, and one phase for each direction (two ways), cross-traffic 
turn may be used as well, which we will refer to as the “symmetrical phase.”

The standard configuration has the advantage of not requiring dedicated queue space (queue box) for 
cross-traffic turns and also allow sharing one lane for cross-turn and straight movements (it can be 
the most median-side or the second closest to it) and let the intensity of the flow variations along 
the day balance the use of this lane. The symmetrical phases are interesting when cross-traffic-turn 
flows are relatively low and straight movements are intense in both ways (cross-traffic-turn phase will 
be short and straight will be long). Our practical experience suggests that symmetrical tends to be better 
if a clear bidirectional flow exists, but it ultimately requires an assessment of the flows intensity 
to each application.

A combination of the two is also possible, using cross-traffic-turn phase for one direction, and one 
phase per origin in the other direction (“mixed-four-phase”).

\figure[medium]{assets/image34.jpeg}{Possible movements and signal phases at a typical four-leg intersection.}{ ITDP.}

\subsubsection{Movements Conflicting with BRT}

\figure[medium]{assets/image36.jpeg}{Along Quito’s Central Norte corridor, vehicles in mixed traffic are given 
a phase to perform left turns. Image}{ Lloyd Wright.}

When the BRT has to cross a typical four-stage intersection, the main concern is to increase the green 
time for the corridor direction. Eliminating phases are likely to be very effective in doing so, but 
it is important to keep in mind that it is not the primary goal. Eliminating phases in a way that green 
time is not increased for the BRT approaches will improve only mixed-traffic performance.

To eliminate the phases we must focus on the *movements that conflict with the BRT* (Figure 24.36) 
and try to reroute them in such a way that they can cross the corridor in one phase and briefly—that 
is, providing width to the crossing movement approaches. Providing width to parallel movements is important 
to improving general traffic, which is also desirable, but not paramount.

*For the remainder of the section we will assume that the busway is median-side aligned and that the 
busway crosses the intersection straight; if the busway is curbside and/or it is turning between perpendicular 
roads, the same reasoning applies and the same alternatives for detour mixed-traffic movements will be 
considered, but in a different and appropriated way.*

With a median-side BRT, standard-four-phase sign can no longer be applied, as it will conflict with 
the cross-traffic turn (Figure 24.35), so the symmetrical or the mixed-four-phase has to be used.

\figure[medium]{assets/image35.jpeg}{With the insertion of BRT (red) in a four-stage signal, the cross-traffic 
turn from the same direction needs to have its own phase.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{Diverting Curbside Turns}


Diverting curbside turns does not remove a phase, but it can free space for queueing and increase capacity 
for the remaining movements.

Moving curbside turns away from the intersection is usually simple if parallel streets are available 
(Figure 24.37). It will require a cross-traffic turn in the parallel street corner, which may start to 
spread the main corridor intersection problems to a broader area. Detouring the curbside flow from the 
crossing street is particularly interesting because it can leave the width of the whole approach available 
to conflict movements, reducing the crossing time (red for the corridor) in the same proportion this 
curbside-turn flow is to the total flow, even if four phases are in use. From a BRT point of view, there 
is no interest in diverting the parallel curbside flow at the intersection, as it is not a conflicting 
movement.

\figure[medium]{assets/image37.jpeg}{Curbside-turn detour can leave width in the main intersection available 
to crossing flows.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{Diverting Cross-Traffic Turns}

There are several ways of eliminating cross-traffic turns in the main intersection by detouring the 
flow. These can be applied both to the flows parallel to the corridor and to the flows crossing the corridor 
(and turning parallel to it). Without cross-traffic turns, the intersection can have only two phases, 
but applying a detour to only one direction (both ways) means eliminating one phase already.

\subsubsection{Curbside-Turn, Cross-Traffic Turn, and Cross-Traffic Turn (“curb-first”)}

This detour follows a curbside detour proposed through auxiliary streets, with a curbside turn at the 
parallel street before the intersection, followed by two successive cross-traffic-side turns (Figure 
24.38). This variation is more effective to apply to the corridor perpendicular to the BRT, as it frees 
width in its main approach to straight flow only. When compared with other alternatives (discussed below) 
this detour might be more beneficial to mixed traffic as opposed to the BRT, since it may justify reduction 
of proportional green time in BRT's direction.

\figure[medium]{assets/image38.png}{By detouring a cross-traffic turn to a curbside parallel street before 
reaching the intersection, a phase is eliminated in the main intersection.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{Loop}

For the loop, the flow looking to perform a cross-traffic turn has to instead cross straight through 
the intersection and perform three curbside turns and then cross straight through the intersection again 
(Figure 24.39 shows an application of this flow that is initially parallel to the BRT), even though this 
has the clear disadvantage of using the intersection twice. Although the other way can be better, this 
alternative is always interesting for the BRT crossing flow, because it necessarily reduces red times. 
For the parallel flow it is interesting while flows are low enough not to take one lane width on the 
crossing-BRT phase.

\figure[medium]{assets/image39.png}{Three curbside turns after crossing the intersection is a simple alternative 
to eliminating cross-traffic turns; despite crossing the intersection twice, it does not create much 
conflict with existing flows.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{Previous Cross Turn (“previous cross”)}

Before reaching the main intersection, the diverted flow is allowed to cross-traffic turn in a location 
where there is no perpendicular crossing traffic (i.e., where previously no crossing intersection existed), 
the opposite straight flow has to be detained to allow this move, but it can be stopped synchronously 
to the main intersection. After the cross, the diverted flow follows perpendicular to the main corridor 
until a suitable location for a curbside turn is reached; from there it will run parallel to the original 
flow in the direction of another intersection in the crossing road, downstream the main intersection, 
where it will join the flow by means of another cross-traffic flow in a two-stage traffic light (where 
previously no crossing existed or now has to be forbidden) also synchronized with the main intersection 
(Figure 24.40).

\figure[medium]{assets/image40.png}{It is possible to provide a two-phase coordination for detouring cross-side 
turns to leave the road upstream and return downstream of the main intersection; additional synchronized 
traffic lights are required.}{ Elebeta.}

The “previous cross” detour is the best alternative for the parallel flow to the BRT corridor that 
wants to turn across traffic on the main intersection because it definitely moves the conflict away from 
the most crowded intersection. But it cannot be applied in both directions (parallel and perpendicular) 
as it would require a three-phase intersection for exiting/returning to the main avenues. It also may 
create capacity conflict if, in the perpendicular direction of approach, the curbside-turn is being diverted, 
so consideration should be taken to redirect it back to regular curbside turning at the intersection. 
If cross-traffic turn, also in the perpendicular direction, is diverted by means of the “curbside first,” 
then serious conflict would rise, so the perpendicular flow shall be redirected to a “loop.”

The previous cross alternative is similar in concept to the “displaced left-turn” intersection in the 
United States (Figure 24.41), which can be applied where width is available.

\figure[medium]{assets/image41.png}{In the United States, the concept of previous turn is applied in a less 
dense urban context by the name of “displaced left turn” intersection.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{Curbside Turn and U-Turn (“curb-u”)}

A cross-traffic-flow detour is made by first making a curbside turn at the crossing road, followed 
by a U-turn in the crossing road at a suitable location approximately one hundred meters from the major 
route, and then driving straight through the intersection. From the main intersection capacity point 
of view, this alternative has no advantage over the loop as it takes away the same width as the loop 
in both approaches. It is suitable when the loop is not an option, because the alternative is already 
congested or too long, which would create political problems with car drivers; besides, there would have 
to be sufficient width to accommodate the U-turn as well as length for a waiting area. To be applied 
to the traffic coming from the perpendicular direction to the BRT, as this movement crosses the bus lanes 
it creates undesirable conflicts for the BRT system. The U-turn traffic light should be two-phase only, 
synchronized with the main intersection.

\figure[medium]{assets/image42.png}{Making a U-turn after entering, by means of a curbside turn, the opposite 
way of the desired direction is another way to perform a cross-traffic turn without need of an exclusive 
phase. This alternative requires a queueing area and uses two approaches to the intersection as well.}{ Elebeta.}

\subsubsection{U-Turn and Curbside Turn (“U-curb”)}

Another alternative is possible by means of making a U-turn at a median break downstream of the crossing 
road, followed by a right turn at the crossing road (Figure 24.43).

The U-turn and queue area may be accommodated at the curbside instead of in the median side, as shown 
in Figures 24.44, 24.45, and 24.46, where it accommodates cross-side-turn detoured flows from both the 
parallel and perpendicular streets: parallel doing U-turn then curbside, the perpendicular doing curbside 
then U-turn.

\figure[medium]{assets/image43.png}{U-turns after crossing the intersection are an alternative to eliminate 
a cross-traffic-turn phase, but they require the flow to cross the intersection twice and require width 
for queueing downstream.}{ Elebeta.}

\figure[medium]{assets/image44.png}{Waiting area for a U-turn can be placed closer to the curb, instead of 
close to the median.}{ Elebeta.}

ends, combined with U-turns.}{ ITDP with GMEDRI.}

\figure[medium]{assets/image46.jpeg}{This intersection near Dongpu BRT Station in Guangzhou was previously 
a major traffic black spot—a location where traffic accidents often occurred—but now it works very smoothly 
for all modes, with a two-phase signal combined with U-turns and pedestrian crossings.}{ Karl Fjellstrom, 
ITDP.}

\subsubsection{Diverting Straight Flow: Parallel Street}

The use of the immediate parallel street in one way as an auxiliary street is an effective alternative 
for mixed traffic. Even a narrow two-way street transformed into a one-way street with parking prohibition 
can be a meaningful alternative for straight traffic and avoid the need for widening and expropriation. 
If applied both to BRT corridor and the corridor crossing, it can alleviate intersections. In São Paulo 
it is common that the “auxiliary” streets end up having higher throughput than the main corridors (Figure 
24.47).

\figure[medium]{assets/image47.png}{Auxiliary street (left) has higher mixed-traffic capacity than the main 
corridor (right) in São Paulo.}{Google Maps.}

\subsubsection{Moving Across or Making a U-turn Away from the Intersection}

If the station location is seen as imperative, the intersection could be closed in order to avoid problems 
with the BRT system operation. Mixed traffic can be detoured around it. The examples for curbside and 
U-turn (Figures 24.48, 24.49, and 24.46) applied this detour to straight movements, too, even if the 
movements do not always surround the station.

it is allowed to perform U-turns away from the station.}{ Google Earth.}

\figure{assets/image49.jpeg}{Dongpu BRT station in Guangzhou (see layout at Figure 24.45) provides 
at-grade station access at both ends, combined with mixed-traffic U-turns.}{ Karl Fjellstrom.}

\subsection{ Creating Two-Phase Intersections}

Many of the detour options assume that an adjacent secondary-street system exists and has the capacity 
to absorb additional traffic caused by the proposed diversions. When they do not exist, widening one 
of the roads to accommodate U-turns and/or previous cross-traffic turns is usually a more feasible alternative. 
Deciding which detour alternatives apply to each flow requires a careful evaluation of both the demand 
intensity and fluctuations throughout the day in the intersection and surrounding streets, as well as 
the possibility of widening the approaches.

An infinite number of designs exist, including roundabouts and hamburger-shaped intersections and others 
that have yet to be created. *The goal is to increase the proportion of green time given for the corridor 
direction*, which will result in a natural increase of capacity for traffic.

*Alternatives that invert the way—that is, making a right-handed system in a location where a left-hand 
system is used or vice versa—should not be proposed* (in our experience, even if the flow is completely 
channeled and pedestrians and bicycle crossings are grade-separated, there should be safer alternatives). 
The common situation of a flowing busway amid congested mixed traffic is enough potential danger to deal 
with at the intersection. The importance of an enforcement policy to slow down BRT drivers in this situation 
cannot be stressed enough.

For mixed traffic in particular, measuring travel time alone is not the right metric to evaluate and 
monitor the quality of a solution. It is very likely (and frustrating) that one will see congestion returning 
after implementation on a major intersection. When that happens, one must remember that, besides accommodating 
rapid public transport, there are capacity gains for mixed traffic. Congestion seems to be the only general 
traffic deterrent, so if a good design will enable more people to cross the intersection by car, then 
that might mean that either travel times or congestion were eliminated somewhere else or that more people 
are willing to come to that area and benefit from the activities that part of the city has to offer.

When the adjacent land use is primarily residential, there is likely to be considerable resistance 
to the above proposals. One should keep in mind that this is a normal pressure of city growth (historically, 
cities grew out of road intersections), and a broader perspective to regulate the use of land may need 
to be brought into the project.

\subsection{ Comparison Examples}

For an initial general analysis of the possible configuration, we graphically present the cycle time 
as a function of required relative green times for vehicular phases (Figure 24.50). We consider both 
the situation where a pedestrian phase is required and not. When required, we assume the pedestrian phase 
will need 10 seconds plus 4 seconds of clearance, which is the time needed for crossing three lanes. 
The clearance (or lost time) for each phase is 4 seconds as well.

\figure[medium]{assets/image50.png}{When demand requirements get too close to traffic signal capacity (overall 
intersection capacity) required cycles get too long very quickly.}{ Elebeta.} 

By observing the chart, it is clear that when the pedestrian crossing phase is present, at the moment  
green times are required to be 75 percent, the intersection is near to collapse. This threshold is between 
80 and 85 percent if no pedestrian phase is required.

The chart also shows that increasing cycles beyond 120 seconds is not efficient in any situation. In 
the best case (4 vehicular phases plus pedestrian phase), increasing it to 150 seconds (+25 percent) 
results in a 5 percent increase in capacity, and raising it to 300 seconds will add 10 percent more capacity. 
Such a desperate measure will of course prevent queueing formation during the peak hour and that certainly 
reduces travel times, but other measures can be much more efficient.

If the BRT users are not to be stuck in traffic, and delay is computed equally to the car users, then 
it is very likely that raising cycle times above 120 seconds will result in overall time losses. Furthermore, 
if curbside turns are detoured or refuge islands are used as discussed in Section 24.9, then a proper 
set of two-phase signals will not require a pedestrian-only phase. In such a situation cycle times above 
60 seconds are likely to be useless, and cycle times above 90 seconds are certainly not justifiable. 
As seen in Section 24.3, short cycles greatly reduce the chances of spillbacks on the busway, hindering 
stations.

For a comparison of different configuration impacts, we will assume a very symmetrical four-leg intersection, 
where the flow from each origin is equal and the left and right turns each represent 25 percent of traffic 
movements, straight represents 50 percent, and there is no U-turn demand. We will also assume a three-lane 
approach for mixed traffic in each leg as previous figures in this section show, with saturation capacity 
flow rate of 1,800 pcu/hour. When required, only one lane is used for cross-traffic turns per approach. 
We maintain the same assumptions to draw the chart regarding clearance times (4 seconds per phase change) 
and pedestrian phases (14 seconds per phase when phase required, and we assume it is not required in 
two-phase intersections).

\subsubsection{Typical Four-Phase Intersection}

For comparing the four-phase intersection, we will fix cycle times at 120 seconds (2 minutes) and evaluate 
the effect of green time for the straight flow in one of the directions considering detouring curbside 
turns for each direction (two ways), and we will divide the overall capacity of the intersection by the 
number of lanes approaching it (NLanes in our example is 12 and results are in table 24.3).

\begintable{Four-Phase Capacity Examples}

\endtable

Under the proposed scenario, a “standard-four-phase” signal has 90 seconds to distribute among the 
phases (30 out of 120 seconds are for pedestrian plus clearance times of phases changes), so this means 
22.5 seconds per phase (rounded to 23 in the table) in the symmetrical situations. By detouring curbside 
turns to one side only (letting only 75 percent of demand be served), 3 seconds can be removed from the 
lesser demanded phases and passed to the other two (19 and 26 seconds); the capacity of each lane of 
each approach is always equal, meaning that 4,050 vehicles overall could pass through the intersection 
in one hour in the 12 lanes (= 338 x 12).

In comparison, the “symmetrical phases,” which do not require a pedestrian phase, can distribute 104 
seconds among the phases, and it ends up being 31 seconds for the straight traffic and 21 seconds for 
the cross-traffic turn (this last information is not on the table but is deductible). If lanes could 
be used in fractions, then allocating three-quarters of a lane to cross-traffic turns would lead to a 
balanced situation of 26 seconds of green time for each phase, which is the case when both curbside turns 
are removed from the intersection.

On the balanced situation, when the symmetrical phases have the lowest capacity, they still have the 
same capacity as the standard phases, the higher throughput being a consequence only of the absence of 
the pedestrian-only phase. As a general rule, symmetrical phases are more efficient than standard phases. 
Mixed-phase results are not shown, but they are in between, closer to standard phases as they require 
pedestrian phases, too.

\subsubsection{Reducing Number of Phases Effects}

The previous discussion about four-phase intersections lay the groundwork for not considering the “mixed-four-phase” 
alternative in the following examples. This is also a reason why there is no need to present a previous 
cross-traffic turn, interlacing the BRT lane and mixed traffic (Figure 24.82), which shifts mixed traffic 
to the median side into a position that allows a standard four-phase intersection to work where no other 
alternative is possible; *the symmetrical-phases signal works better*.

To compare the effects of alternative schemes for phase reduction, we will consider a 90-second cycle 
time without a pedestrian-only phase but with an additional BRT lane in one direction on the median side 
(also as shown on most figures in this section). The resulting green time for the BRT for each alternative 
is presented beside the intersection capacity of mixed traffic in Table 24.4, where:

\item \highlight{Average lane capacity:} the average of the mixed-traffic lanes capacity that would 
be measured at the stop lines approaching the main intersection;
\item \highlight{Overall intersection capacity per lane:} in certain configurations, some vehicles pass 
through two stop lines in order to execute their turning movements, and this measure would be similar 
to average lane capacity above, except that it does not count the second passage of the same vehicle.
\item \highlight{Total throughput with auxiliary intersections per lane at intersection: }this adds 
the flows that were completely diverted away from the main intersection (curbside-turn detour and previous 
cross-traffic-turn detour) as if they were effectively passing through the intersection. By bringing 
the value to the number of lanes of the intersection, this presents a practical estimate of how much 
the capacity of the main intersection can be pushed to benefit from using the auxiliary ones.

\endtable

In our scenario, detouring all curbside turns away implies that 25 percent of cars are not using the 
approaching lanes to the intersection, and 75 percent of them are. So for each vehicle at the intersection, 
there is an additional third outside, which means a 33 percent increase in “intersection capacity.”

In comparison with the four-phase (symmetrical) signal, even the three-phase signal implies a considerable 
increase of green time for the BRT. Reducing 4 phases to 3 leads to a 25 percent increase for the capacity 
at the intersection (and 50 percent considering auxiliary intersections) with satisfactory relative green 
time near 50 percent. Meanwhile, from the point of view of mixed traffic throughput, the reduction from 
4 to 2 phases in the worst cases (U-turn alternatives and only loops: J, L, and M), an 80 percent increase 
for the throughput occurs at the intersection, and in the best alternative (option I), there is a 107 
percent increase at the intersection while green times are in the same range (except for alternative 
M, which uses U-turns at the perpendicular street). Implementing a two-phase signal is clearly the best 
thing to do.

When traffic signals are balanced to serve the demand with a two-phase traffic signal, it will result 
in the capacity of about 820 pcu/hour. For this situation a cycle of 90 seconds with 4 seconds of clearance 
is typically used. Additionally, if the flow looking to turn is placed on the (curbside) parallel streets 
in both directions (option I), then one can reach an equivalent of 1,092 pcu/hour. This results in 60 
percent of uninterrupted lane capacity as an average for two directions, which is likely to represent 
75 percent of the average of the best grade-separated solution and be better than many graded-separated 
solutions (see Section: 24.10.3 Restricting Turning Movements Together with Grade Separation). Plus, 
this is 320 percent of the average capacity of a standard four-phase intersection. Clearly, the consideration 
of the detour alternatives to reduce signal phases can do a lot to increase green time for the corridor 
as well as capacity for mixed traffic.
