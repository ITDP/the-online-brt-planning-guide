> Well, you would have to say what is the criteria to determine the success of any merger? It would have to be that the companies are stronger financially, that they took market share, and they are on a very steady footing in terms of their performance.

Sometimes a BRT system must pass through a narrow stretch of road that is impossible to widen. Such 
areas may include bridges, tunnels, city gates, or flyovers. As shown below, having the BRT running with 
mixed traffic only in this narrow section may not be too harmful for the public transport system if appropriate 
measures are taken.

This situation can be seen as an intersection (a form of a bottleneck) as there is conflict for using 
the same space. Usually the heaviest congestion occurs not on the narrow link but just before it, forming 
a large queue just to enter onto the bottleneck point. When the facility itself is not congested, only 
the approach to the facility, a traffic signal is generally not needed, and it may be better to end the 
exclusive busway just a short distance before the bottleneck. The distance should be sufficient only 
to allow a convenient distance for merging (40 to 80 meters). This curtailment of the busway will allow 
BRT buses to pass through most of the congestion point without provoking any reduction of mixed traffic 
capacity at the critical section (Figure 24.64).

If the critical link is an approach to a signalized intersection (Figure 24.65), then BRT should be 
given signal priority (active priority if BRT has lower frequency, passive priority in all other cycles), 
and the head start in the green phase (Theadstart) should be given by:

Eq. 24.26\' TODO Math: 

Theadstart=Diststop-to-narrow-sectionStartSpeedBRT '\

Where:

T\sub{headstart} = Time of head start in the green phase;

Dist\sub{stop-to-narrow-section} = Distance between the stop line of the signal preceding the narrow section;

StartSpeed\sub{BRT} = An average head start speed that the BRT vehicle needs as an advantage over mixed traffic 
to reach the section first. We suggest 3 m/s (~ 11 km/hour). Using meters and seconds the equation becomes:\' TODO Math: 

Theadstartseconds=Diststop-to-narrow-sectionmeters3 '\

priority is to be given to BRT (passive or active).}{ITDP}

The example given in Figure 24.65 essentially acts as a queue-jumping mechanism in which the BRT vehicles 
are given an advantage through a bottleneck point.

The head start, however, is useless if the facility itself also becomes congested. If there is a risk 
that the bottleneck facility itself may become congested (due to mixed traffic spillback of conflicts 
ahead of the narrow section), active signal priority based on the detection of mixed traffic should be 
used. 

The signal before the section would work normally (or if a signal did not exist one would be created 
and flash yellow) until traffic detectors note that the narrow link has become congested (at its most 
downstream portion). At that point, the signal would be activated, and a red light would be given to 
mixed traffic until the narrow section clears. The use of such a traffic signal will help to avoid congestion 
inside the busway. Instead the delay is transferred to the mixed traffic in the previous link, resulting 
in improved velocity for BRT vehicles at the narrow link. For tunnels, this approach has the extra advantage 
of avoiding idling vehicles within heavily polluted conditions.
