While service plan simplification and organization may, to an extent, minimize turning movements for 
BRT vehicles in the busway, by concentrating service access to the corridor in a few intersections, turning 
is necessary and desired where it best serves the demand (in opposition to allowing it where it is convenient 
by geometry). By planning BRT routes that change between corridors (i.e., with turns), easy platform 
transfers for the customers are made possible, better, or not even necessary for most users. Thus, turning 
movements by BRT vehicles should be an integral part of designing an effective overall route structure. 
As the BRT system expands and provides an increasingly dense network of lines, the connections between 
these lines become more complex. While a BRT system expands, a growing number of trunk corridors crossing 
each other is expected.

The costs of not allowing turning movements by BRT vehicles are quite evident, especially in terms 
of customer convenience. Quito’s three BRT corridors (Trolé, Ecovía, and Metrobus-Q) all operate as independent 
corridors, despite each intersecting one another at several points in the city. At one of the critical 
intersections between two intersecting BRT corridors in Bogotá (Caracas and Jimenez), customers must 
transfer by negotiating passages along stairs and an underground tunnel (Figures 24.51 and 24.52). In 
both these examples, allowing turning movements by the BRT vehicles could have permitted simpler and 
more convenient platform transfers for the customer. Furthermore, constructing connecting pedestrian 
tunnels can add much to the overall infrastructure costs of the system. This is copying the bad parts 
of rail systems. In the Bogotá situation, customer convenience has been significantly increased by allowing 
turn movements and direct transfers between the Caracas and Jimenez corridors. 

There are several solutions to allow BRT vehicle turning that avoid consuming much of an intersection’s 
capacity—mostly needed for cars in the intersection—and the appropriate solutions will depend on the 
available budget and right-of-way, the number of vehicles in the BRT system and their turning volumes, 
and the level of mixed traffic and its turning volumes. The optimal solution will be location-specific 
and each intersection must be evaluated and optimized separately. Here are common options for busway 
turning movements:

\number Dedicated turning lanes and additional signal phases for BRT vehicles;
\number BRT vehicles operating in mixed-traffic turning lanes;
\number BRT turning movements prior to the intersection;
\number Transform the crossing into a roundabout;
\number Grade separation (discussed in Section 24.10).

\subsection{ Dedicated Turning Lanes and Additional Signal Phases for BRT Vehicles}

\figure{assets/image53.jpeg}{The green phase for a BRT vehicle entering the Val de Marne busway in 
Paris.}{National Bus Rapid Transit Institute (NBRTI).}

A dedicated turning lane for BRT vehicles has the advantage of keeping the BRT vehicles in a controlled 
space at all times (see Figure 24.53). This arrangement may require an additional signal phase if there 
was no previous cross-traffic-turn phase. Otherwise, the dedicated turn would take place at the same 
time that the mixed traffic is allowed to turn left.

Possibly the greatest challenge to this configuration is finding the physical space to place the additional 
turning lane. The roadway would likely have to accommodate at least five lanes (Figure 24.54). If two 
lanes of mixed traffic in each direction are to be maintained for straight-car movements, then seven 
lanes of road space would be required.

\figure[medium]{assets/image55.png}{In order to permit the BRT turning movements suggested in Figure 24.54, 
a three-phase traffic signal would be required.}{ ITDP.}

The configuration suggested in Figure 24.54 would require a three-phase traffic signal, as indicated 
in Figure 24.55, and in the case of a median-station configuration it can provide full access to all 
route permutations without walking: a southbound vehicle turning east will give customers access to westbound 
routes via the platform transfer at the first station. In designing this option, one would choose the 
highest demand routes to receive the transfer-free routing.

In this scenario, one could technically also allow cross-traffic-turn movements for mixed-traffic vehicles 
for traffic from north and south, but even more additional lanes would be required. Ideally though, mixed 
traffic should be diverted as proposed in the previous section (Section 24.5: Restricting General Traffic 
Turning Movements) as the BRT cross-traffic turn phase will usually be very short (like the queue-jumping 
phase proposed in 24.5.2.1).

If the turning BRT vehicle frequencies are low enough, the BRT-only short phase can accommodate both 
right and left turns from one direction as BRT vehicles’ drivers can negotiate entrance to the other 
corridor. That would avoid the need for two waiting lanes for turns.

The complexity of dedicated turning lanes obviously increases as turning options for both BRT vehicles 
and mixed-traffic vehicles increase. In the extreme case of permitting all BRT turning options and all 
mixed-traffic turning options, then a total of six traffic-signal phases would be required (Figure 24.56). 
This number of phases clearly holds disadvantages in terms of waiting times for both BRT and mixed-traffic 
 movements and reduces the capacity of the intersection so drastically—besides requiring four lanes, 
four BRT lanes, and likely six for mixed traffic—that is very likely to not be feasible in a location 
where two important corridors cross each other.

six signal phases would be required.}{ ITDP.}

\subsection{ BRT Vehicles Operating in Mixed-Traffic Turning Lanes}

In this scenario, all turning BRT vehicles must leave the dedicated busway and enter mixed-traffic 
lanes. Thus, a cross-traffic-turning BRT vehicle will leave the busway and directly enter the cross-traffic-turn 
lane for cars. A curbside-turning BRT vehicle must leave the median-side busway and merge to the curbside 
of the street to reenter the median-side busway on the new corridor.

\figure{assets/image57.jpeg}{In Kunming, turning BRT vehicles leave the busway and enter a mixed-traffic 
lane to finalize the turning movement.}{ ITDP.}

This technique is the most common solution that has been used in many of the “open” BRT systems, such 
as in Kunming, China, and is being planned on several “direct services” BRT systems (Figure 24.57). If 
there is no physical separation of the busway, the merge with the mixed traffic can happen anywhere in 
the proceeding block. If there is physical separation, it must occur at the previous intersection, or 
a slip lane must be provided. 

From a signal phase standpoint, this option is the easiest to implement, as it does not require changing 
the signal phase, and does not require any major new infrastructure. However, this option does present 
serious disadvantages in terms of congestion delay for the turning BRT vehicles, not to mention the assumed 
inefficiency of four stages to mixed traffic. Further, if the mixed-traffic congestion is heavy, the 
BRT vehicles attempting to turn may not be able to readily leave the busway, and thus can cause delays 
to all BRT vehicles, even those vehicles continuing in a straight routing. The BRT vehicle turning right 
has particular challenges since it must essentially cross all mixed-traffic lanes both before and after 
the intersection. Attempting these lane changes is particularly difficult if the system is using 18.5-meter 
articulated vehicles or 24-meter bi-articulated vehicles.

Any time BRT vehicles must leave an exclusive busway operation and enter mixed-traffic lanes the system 
loses a certain amount of psychological status with the customer. Mixed-traffic operation makes the system 
much more akin to a conventional bus system rather than a highly efficient public transport system. 

\subsubsection{Queue-Jump Signalization for BRT Vehicles (Pre-Signals)}

\figure[medium]{assets/image58.jpeg}{While mixed-traffic vehicles are held for an extra ten seconds at the 
first traffic-signal stop, BRT vehicles are given a queue-jumping head start. Technically this counts 
as eight phases.}{TCRP}

\figure[medium]{assets/image59.jpeg}{Pre-signals for buses, holding normal vehicles in Cape Town, South Africa, 
work like a queue jump to a straight movement in a mixed-traffic section.}{ Bruce Sutherland.}

A signal system can be utilized to give BRT vehicles a head start on turning movements prior to private-vehicle 
turning movements. In this case, a dual traffic signal is utilized for each direction of travel. One 
traffic signal is located at the intersection, and another traffic signal is located approximately 30 
to 50 meters prior to the intersection. At the traffic signal prior to the intersection, the BRT vehicles 
on the busway would receive a green signal of approximately 10 seconds prior to the green signal for 
the mixed traffic (Figure 24.58). During this head start, the BRT vehicle would be able to exit the busway 
and cross to the other side of the street. This is the equivalent of having eight stages and, besides 
the same problems with congestion in mixed traffic, a BRT vehicle that arrives in the middle of the green 
phase will be blocked by cross-traffic-turning cars and block eventual vehicles behind it. Figure 24.59 
shows an example of pre-signal without BRT turning; it is used as a way to allow mixed traffic turn cross-traffic 
when the roadway width is constrained.

\subsection{BRT Turning Movements Prior to the Intersection}

To avoid having a special BRT turning phase in a main intersection, an alternative is to create a special 
bus-only turn (this is as good for left turns as for right) phase at an intersection before a major intersection 
where there is less crossing demand than in the main crossing corridor, or no demand at all (Figure 24.60). 
For a few blocks, the BRT vehicle will operate on secondary streets (in mixed traffic or in a dedicated 
lane) until it rejoins the busway. This option requires the availability of usable secondary streets 
and consideration regarding the placement and use of stations by turning routes (not to move it too far 
from the origin/destination of many trips on the other side of the main intersection).

\figure[medium]{assets/image60.png}{In this scenario, the BRT turning movement is made prior to the main intersection.

\subsection{ Convert Cross into a Roundabout}

If two crossing corridors happen to be two broad highways, enough right-of-way may be available to 
convert a standard four-phase intersection into a two-phase signalized roundabout. This is a clever alternative 
that should be remembered, as in many developing-nation cities, such right-of-way is available but underutilized. 

The exclusive BRT busway terminates approximately 50 meters prior to the intersection with the BRT 
vehicles entering mixed traffic at that point. This approach essentially turns the junction into a grid 
of one-way streets. It requires a fairly large amount of right-of-way at the junction. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image61.png}{In this scenario, the intersection is converted to a roundabout with vehicle 
queuing areas at points “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D.” The BRT vehicles enter mixed traffic just before the 
intersection and move through the intersection with a two-phase signal.}{ITDP}

Figure 24.61 indicates how the junction between two major boulevards can be turned into a two-phase 
traffic circle by creating a kind of mini-grid of one-way streets. At low traffic volumes, the BRT buses 
enter mixed traffic prior to the intersection. A series of queuing areas (marked as “A,” “B,” “C,” and 
“D” in the figure) help stage vehicle flows through the roundabout. These areas are referred to as “waiting 
boxes.”

\figure[medium]{assets/image62.png}{Vehicle movements for signal phase 1 in a cross converted into a roundabout. 
Image}{ ITDP.}

Figure 24.62 outlines the vehicle movements for the first signal phase for this roundabout conversion. 
This example is given from the perspective of a British-style road configuration. All eastbound BRT vehicles 
and mixed-traffic vehicles that are making right-hand turns would pass through the intersection and queue 
in area “C” at a traffic light. All east- and westbound traffic can proceed straight. All vehicles making 
left-hand turns can proceed. All westbound traffic would pass through the intersection and queue in area 
“B.”

\figure[medium]{assets/image63.png}{Vehicle movements for signal phase 2 in a cross converted into roundabout. 
Image}{ ITDP.}

In the second signal phase, all northbound and southbound traffic can proceed straight, all left-hand 
turns can proceed, and all right turning traffic would queue in areas “A” and “D” (Figure 24.63). 

This solution will work up to the point where the amount of space in areas “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D” is 
sufficient to accommodate all the turning traffic. The required and available space are discussed in 
Box 24.2. 

Opposite of the rule to increase capacity, the cycle on a signalized roundabout of this type should 
be short, so the queueing box can handle volumes (manual operators must be very careful when handling 
these intersections, keeping an eye on the queueing boxes to decide when to alternate to the next phase). 
Other alternatives of busways through roundabouts are discussed in the next section.

\beginbox{Required and available space for queueing boxes:}

For the purpose of evaluating queueing space, we consider that:

\item The amount of road space that a passenger car practically uses is 15 square meters; this includes 
some distance kept between vehicles to separate them from each other when queueing at the traffic light 
(Areapcu = 15 m2);
\item The amount of road space needed for a 12 meter-bus to queue is 30 square meters, therefore its 
equivalence factor is 2.0, i.e., one 12 meter-bus uses twice the space a pcu;
\item An articulated BRT vehicle has an equivalent factor of 3.5 pcu;

The available area capacity and the required area (or demanded area) to transform a cross into a roundabout 
are:

Eq. 24.24\' TODO Math: 

AvailableCapacityqueue-box=Areawait-boxAreapcu '\

Where:

AvailableCapacity\sub{queue-box} = Number of cars that fit in wait box (in pcu);

Area\sub{wait-box} = Amount of space in the wait box (either A, B, C or D in Figure 24.61);

Area\sub{pcu} = Amount of road space a passenger-car uses = 15 m2 (it should be expressed in the same unit 
of areawait-box).

Eq. 24.25\' TODO Math: 

RequiredCapacitywait-box=Flowleft-turn*Timecycle '\

Where:

RequiredCapacity\sub{wait-box} = Number of cars that need to fit in wait box (in the same unit the numerator 
of the measure described below, normally pcu);

Flow\sub{left-turn} = Number of vehicles that turn left during the peak (normally expressed in pcu/hour, 
see basic concepts of this chapter);

Time\sub{cycle} = Time duration of a complete traffic light cycle during the peak (normally expressed in 
seconds, so here the same unit of the flow above needs to be converted, dividing the value by 3,600).

In order for the configuration to function, the available space capacity must be equal or greater than 
the required capacity.

*Example*

The following scenario provides an example of calculating the required and available capacity of the 
proposed roundabout queuing space:
\item Turning movement = 540 pcu/hour = 0.15 pcu/sec;
\item Cycle time = 90 sec.

\highlight{Required capacity = 0.15 \* 90 = 13.5 pcu}
\item Unitary pcu space = 3 m \* 5 m = 15 m2;
\item Length = 30 m;
\item Width = 12 m.

\highlight{Available capacity = (30 m \* 12 m) / (15 m2/pcu) = 24 pcu}

In this case, the available capacity is greater than the required capacity (24 pcu ≥ 13.5 pcu), so 
the proposed roundabout conversion could function.

Considering the Figure 23.61, when the number of mixed traffic vehicles and BRT vehicles rises to the 
point that areas “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D” are too small to accommodate them all, turns should be restricted 
for mixed traffic but not for BRT vehicles. Effectively, the queuing areas “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D” would 
be reserved for BRT vehicles.
