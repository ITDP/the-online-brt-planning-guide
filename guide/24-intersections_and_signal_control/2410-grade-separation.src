\section{Grade Separation}

\quotation{Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is not the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.}

Grade separation brings many benefits from the perspective of travel time savings by raising intersection 
capacity for both BRT vehicles and mixed traffic vehicles. But the infrastructure can be costly, depending 
on local circumstances. In many instances, the time savings to BRT customers and to private vehicles 
will fully justify the added infrastructure costs, but limited capital resources will typically constrain 
infrastructure expenditures. 

\subsection{Criteria for Grade Separation}

In all of our BRT studies to date we have never really had to resort to a single flyover, meaning that 
there were always solutions to guarantee BRT operations that would reduce overall current travel times 
with the available space. In other words: without resorting to grade separation, solutions are likely 
to be found where the advantages to public transport customers are greater than the hindrance to private 
vehicle users. 

Nonetheless, when the capacity of a four-phase intersection is reaching saturation (more than 450 vehicles/lane/hour 
in 180-second cycle times), it is fairly typical for engineers to suggest the construction of a flyover 
or an underpass that allows straight movement for one main road (two of the twelve movements), while 
all other movements remain at the same level. Such general inclinations often lead toward a political 
understanding that flyover constructions along the BRT corridor are necessary. Besides that, a corridor 
project usually has to deal with existing flyovers.

The introduction or existence of flyovers or underpasses along the corridor requires special treatments 
for BRT systems, but they represent an opportunity to dramatically improve BRT vehicle operation. Exclusive 
busway use of a flyover is a successful technique used in several existing BRT systems despite its potential 
major adverse visual impacts, which are highly undesirable from an aesthetics standpoint in cities and 
urban areas.

An ideal separated-grade solution should only let low intensity intersections remain (low enough to 
not require traffic lights). If it removes mixed traffic and BRT intersections, then it is best to keep 
BRT at the grade where access is facilitated, likely to be street level with at-grade crossing. 

If the grade-separation solution will not eliminate all conflicts, the first option is to use grade-separation 
infrastructure for BRT usage and exclusively for BRT if needed.

While the discussion in this section is concentrated on flyovers as a means of grade separation, underpasses 
are frequently the preferred option from an aesthetics standpoint. Generally, the cost of a busway on 
a flyover will be at least ten times the cost of a normal at-grade busway (per kilometer). The cost of 
a busway in an underpass will be similar to that of a flyover unless there are adverse subsurface conditions 
such as the presence of services (utilities), high water tables, or hard rock conditions that may result 
in underpasses not being technically or economically feasible.

\subsection{Station Location with Grade-Separated Solutions}

If the grade-separated solution design maintains BRT lanes through intersections, the same concerns 
discussed without grade separation about queue blocking the stations apply. When a BRT lane is grade 
separated, hindering the station is not a concern, but effective pedestrian access becomes a major issue.

In most instances (ramp of 3 percent and headroom of 4 to 5 meters), grade separation will require 
placing the stations more than three hundred meters away from the intersection. This siting restriction 
will add walking time for customers travelling between the station and the intersection and nearby destinations 
adjacent to the area. Quito’s Central Norte line uses grade separation quite effectively with tunnels 
whisking BRT vehicles through congested intersections. However, the tunnels also imply that at important 
destinations, such as the Plaza de las Américas, the closest station is a considerable distance away 
(Figure 24.74). Thus, for the likely high number of customers using this busy area, the time savings 
from the grade separation can essentially be lost due to the longer walk.

\figure[medium]{assets/image74.jpeg}{In the case of Quito’s Central Norte line, the presence of a BRT underpass 
has meant that the closest station to a key destination, the Plaza of Américas commercial center, is 
several hundred meters away.}{Lloyd Wright.} 

As an alternative to obtain intersection efficiency (with time savings that serve all customers through 
the section) at the cost of a convenient station location (that serves local-specific customers), it 
is possible to place the station beneath or above the intersection. The Metro Center station of the Washington 
Metro exits directly into the basement floors of commercial shops. In such cases, though, accessing ground-level 
shops and offices will require a grade transfer for customers, implying either stairs, escalators, and/or 
elevators.

Both the Brisbane and Ottawa BRT systems site stations at the tunnel level. In Brisbane, the station 
is just before the tunnel and thus provides good customer access to local destinations (Figure 24.75). 
In Ottawa, the station connects directly to a commercial shopping center (Figure 24.76). Further, in 
the case of Ottawa, the tunnel station nicely protects customers from the harsh winter weather. Quito 
also has achieved great success with its Villa Flora station, which goes beneath a heavily trafficked 
roundabout on Maldonado Avenue (Figure 24.77).

Effective pedestrian access as well as visually neutral solutions can be designed. For TransMilenio 
Phase II’s “Avenida Boyacá” station along the Avenida Suba Corridor, the solution was to locate the station 
above Avenida Boyacá, level with the flyover. Pedestrians access the platform via an elevator from a 
small pedestrian plaza where fares are collected. This solution allowed for the strategic location of 
this station, which will make future transfer points on the projected Avenida Boyacá closer to each other. 
Ultimately, the implementation of solutions of this sort will depend on budgetary constraints.

\subsection{Restricting Turning Movements Together with Grade Separation}

As said in the introduction to this section, unless all vehicle intersections are eliminated from the 
BRT lane by the separated-grade solution, the first option is to consider grade-separation infrastructure 
to be used by the BRT. In such cases, the concern is to determinate if cost of a separated-grade station 
can be afforded and is justified by the time saved by users of that station. This cost consists of the 
infrastructure and/or the time losses generated to private vehicle users that will lose a second or a 
third lane on the separated-grade infrastructure (and if it is politically affordable, too).

A second possibility is to direct BRT vehicles to the flyover in mixed traffic (see Section 24.7: Merging 
with Mixed Traffic in Narrow Sections), which will result in stations being far from the intersections. 
Additionally, this configuration can be particularly problematic if there is a connecting BRT corridor 
running on the perpendicular street below the flyover or above the underpass.

The third possibility is building the flyover on the road perpendicular to the BRT corridor. In this 
case, the flyover does not introduce any special difficulty in relation to the (same-level) intersection 
already discussed and if it cannot eliminate the intersection with mixed traffic, it can certainly alleviate 
the intensity and the number of conflicts, increasing the BRT green time (as this subsection will lead 
us to conclude by analyzing the following last possibility).

The last possibility is that the flyover is designated for mixed traffic alone and BRT remains on the 
street level. As the others do not create intersection with BRT, this fourth possibility is only of interest 
for the remainder of this subsection (though all four must be considered when evaluating benefits).

\figure{assets/image82.png}{Schematic of Delhi roadway in which BRT vehicles must cross mixed traffic 
that is attempting to access a flyover. Image}{Elebeta.}

If a single flyover in the median is built, the BRT vehicles in the median will have to cross the mixed 
traffic going onto the flyover. This scenario creates either the need for a new signalized intersection 
prior to the flyover, or a merging lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing 
possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic. Figure 24.82 shows the conflict.

\figure[medium]{assets/image83.png}{In Senen Street, TransJakarta interlaces with mixed traffic to avoid the 
flyover and reach the station near the intersection. The restart of the bus lane is on the ground level, 
close to the flyover. The flyover has two lanes and only two more are available to reach the intersection 
below it. The covered pedestrian flyover seen at the left is a link between the inside area of stations 
in BRT Corridor 2 and Corridor 6 as the user cannot leave the system's “paid areas.”}{Google Maps.} 

\figure{assets/image84.png}{Alternative design for a flyover that allows BRT vehicles to proceed without 
conflicts to the area below the flyover.}{Elebeta.}

If two separate access lanes are constructed for the flyover, one for each traffic direction, it is 
possible to leave a space between them for the BRT system to continue along the surface as in Figure 
24.84.

In this configuration, the BRT will intersect the crossing street under the flyover, so we must consider 
the alternatives of Section 24.5 with the introduction of the flyover to reduce the number of phases. 
We present the results of a scenario in which BRT has a green signal with the insertion of a grade-separation 
infrastructure of two lanes per way (Figures 24.87 to 24.89), maintaining the assumptions in subsection 
24.5.4: volumes are equal in all approaches, right and left turns each represent 25 percent of the demand 
and no U-turns are allowed (therefore 50 percent of traffic is straight), no pedestrian-only phases are 
required (it is possible to cross the intersection with the given phases), and 90 seconds is still the 
cycle time of reference.

Although the flyover can cause the impression that four new lanes are created, no mid-block extra width 
is created (Figures 24.82 and 24.84). Eventually the intersection under the flyover can have some extra 
width, but usually two lanes near the median are used to place the supporting structure of the flyover, 
so there is in fact only two extra lanes in the intersection as a whole. Below, we will evaluate the 
uninterrupted flow in these four lanes.

In our example, the first problem with the mixed traffic comes at the point of flyover access, as half 
of the traffic has turning intentions, and if permitted to do this, turns at the intersection (under 
the flyover or above the tunnel) are not enough. Or, if the detours start after the ramp begins, the 
single lane given for mixed traffic to stay on the flyover is not enough. Widening or sharing space with 
BRT is required. The solution presented in Section 24.7 does not apply here without further complications 
as there are two downstream sections (overpass and ground) to be managed. Designing with the assumption 
that the intersection will not congest because the design is good for the forecast demand is simply naive: 
when it comes to cars, all the designer can expect is to improve capacity, and sooner or later congestion 
will return. Given our goals, placing BRT in a shared space with cars in this potential bottleneck is 
a bad proposal.

So the maximum capacity we present for mixed traffic is still subject to the intersection below the 
flyover working well. If it gets congested, access to the flyover will also be congested. For proper 
comparison with the solutions without grade separation, and also because the effective access to the 
“intersection plus flyover” set has three lanes for mixed traffic, we present the results per lane, assuming 
each intersection approach has three lanes, as detailed below:
\item *Average lane capacity:* the average of the mixed-traffic lanes’ capacity that would be measured 
at the stop lines approaching the main intersection. On the presence of a flyover, mixed traffic parallel 
to the BRT’s approach is considered three lanes, but only two of these were effectively used to balance 
the traffic sign);
\item *Overall intersection capacity per lane:* in the loop configuration, vehicles pass twice through 
stop lines in order to execute a cross-traffic turn, and the second pass does not count toward this capacity, 
but rather it is the same result described in the “average lane capacity” above, except that it does 
not count the second passage of the same vehicle across the intersection.
\item *Total throughput with flyover and auxiliary intersections per lane at intersection:* this adds 
in the flows that were completely diverted away from the main intersection (detours and flyover) as if 
they were effectively passing through the intersection. By bringing the value to the number of lanes 
of the intersection, this presents a practical estimate of how much the capacity of the main intersection 
can be pushed to benefit from using the auxiliary ones and flyover as a whole.

Options where the detours are below the flyover assume that the height clearance makes it possible, 
which is not always the case. Access ramps to and from perpendicular streets may also be taken into account 
in order to make turning detours on the flyover possible.

\figure{assets/image85.jpeg}{While vehicles in mixed traffic can bypass a congested intersection in 
Bangkok, public transport vehicles are often consigned to serving stations near the intersection. This 
can result in slow average speeds for public transport.}{Lloyd Wright.} 

Option A1 is fairly common with conventional bus services (as in Bangkok, Figure 24.85) and BRT (as 
in Jakarta, Figure 24.86). Mixed-traffic vehicles have access to the flyover and thus are given a substantial 
priority at the intersection. By contrast, public transport vehicles servicing the intersection area 
are often mired in heavy congestion. There is limited benefit of using a flyover or underpass if a four-phase 
signal timing is maintained. In our established scenario, the overall increase in the whole intersection 
capacity is quite small, with the capacity only rising from 395 pcu/lane/hour to 439 pcu/lane/hour.

\figure[medium]{assets/image86.png}{This five-leg intersection under the Senen Street flyover in Jakarta has 
several forbidden turns; the intersection of two BRT corridors and a four phase-signal causes delays 
in both corridors and is even worse than mixed traffic.}{Google Maps.} 

Using three phases, moving from option E to option E1, curiously adds no benefit with the use of the 
flyover. Even with 50 percent of the traffic being diverted to the flyover and the reduction of the approach 
parallel to the BRT from three to two lanes (while one lane is used for cross-traffic turns), only one 
lane is able to process both curbside turns, and cross-traffic turns from the perpendicular direction 
all result in the same relative green distribution with or without the flyover. But mixed traffic using 
only one lane for such a long phase (the same as the BRT phase) reduces the intersection’s overall capacity 
substantially (71.5 percent). Adding the flow on the flyover (60 percent) results in exactly what is 
coincidentally the same overall capacity as having an intersection plus flyover.

Without a flyover, the best observed configurations consist of the following options: (Option I from 
Table 4.5, Figure 24.87) doing all detours on the curbside parallel street to turn onto the desired direction 
once the other street is reached, letting only straight flows in the perpendicular street and in the 
flyover is the Option (I1) that results in larger capacity for mixed traffic and not coincidentally the 
shortest green time for the BRT (27 seconds), except for the four-stage alternative (A1). That happens 
because the only conflict left at the main intersection is perpendicular straight flow (in three lanes) 
against perpendicular cross-traffic turn (in two lanes). Having 63 seconds of red time may not be unbearable 
for a low frequency BRT, but it will almost certainly not allow a station to be positioned between the 
two intersections (the main and the auxiliary), since the resulting saturation for the conjunct station 
plus intersection will be much higher than that of a station alone.

\figure[medium]{assets/image87.png}{Curbside detour for perpendicular flows under the flyover.}{Elebeta.}

Applying the same scheme, but using the flyover (Option I2, Figure 24.88), moves all the conflicts 
to the secondary intersection, which ends up being the capacity limiting element for the conjunct. As 
there are only two lanes in the flyover to handle the straight flow plus the cross-traffic flow from 
both directions (i.e., double flow in two-thirds of lanes), its result is worse than some alternatives 
without a flyover.

\figure[medium]{assets/image88.png}{Curbside detour for perpendicular flows above the flyover.}{Elebeta.}

For the clovelike alternatives (Options K, K1, K2), adding the flyover and maintaining the loops on 
the ground (Option K1) raises overall capacity for the system by 15 percent (comparing with option K). 
Making detours in auxiliary streets to take the bridge (Option K2, figure 24.89) will make it look like 
a “real-clove interchange” and, except for the BRT, there would be no intersection (pedestrian phase 
is required now). Therefore, the BRT phase would be the minimal 10 seconds and an equivalent average 
capacity of lanes would be 1,520 pcu/hour. Nevertheless, as all vehicles willing to do cross-traffic 
turns at the intersection use it twice, this is equivalent to “only” 1,216 pcu/hour.

\figure[medium]{assets/image89.png}{Clovelike intersection.}{Elebeta.}

The fact that this situation is equivalent to a BRT cross only, the cycle time can be reduced to BRT 
maximum red time requirements. If this requirement is 50 seconds, then the intersection cycle can be 
60 seconds (Option K3) and equivalent overall capacity is reduced to 992 pcu/hour/lane. If it is 35 seconds 
(maybe enough to bring the station 20 meters from the intersection and fit under the flyover), the cycle 
has to be 45 seconds (Option K4) and capacity is further reduced to 992 pcu/hour in our example.

Although generic, the assumptions of this exercise are quite common, so there is a strong suggestion 
that:
\item Without grade separation, reducing signal phases to two can provide solutions as good as many 
grade-separated solutions in terms of capacity for mixed traffic and results in better BRT green times 
than grade-separated solutions.
\item To prioritize BRT green times and meaningfully increase capacity, the use of separated-grade solutions 
must be cleverly associated with turn restrictions, and the *best solutions are obtained if the flyover 
is on the perpendicular road* (had that been the case of options I1 and K2, green times for the BRT would 
be respectively 54 and 76 seconds in a cycle of 90 seconds).

As mentioned before, an intersection cannot be analyzed in isolation. Optimum results are usually obtained 
when vehicle movements are analyzed along the corridor and the entire extended area surrounding the intersection.


\subsection{BRT Turning with Grade-Separated Solutions}

Separated-grade infrastructure can also be used to provide the dedicated turns for the BRT. For heavy 
traffic corridors where free-flow turning is required to avoid breaking down the system, the time savings 
certainly justify the costs.

Bogotá utilizes grade separation to provide dedicated turning infrastructure to BRT operations, such 
as overpasses and underpasses that link the corridors of 80th Street and Norte-Quito-Sur to an exclusive 
BRT roundabout (Figures 24.90 and 24.91), as well as provide an exceptional BRT-only third-floor roundabout 
completed in 2015 to guarantee that the interchange in Norte-Quito-Sur and Calle 6 has no delays (Figures 
24.92 and 24.93).

\figure{assets/image91.jpeg}{At the major intersection of TransMilenio’s Calle 80 corridor and NQS

\subsection{BRT through Roundabouts with Grade-Separated Solutions}

Constructing a busway underpass that goes below the roundabout and avoids all conflicts with mixed 
traffic—and thus promotes time savings for both BRT and mixed traffic—is also a possibility, as the examples 
from Quito with good and bad station locations show (Figures 24.74 and 24.94).

\figure[medium]{assets/image94.png}{Quito's BRT avoids the Villa Flora roundabout traffic with underpasses.}{Google Earth.} 

A flyover is also a possibility, but the design of an aesthetically acceptable solution is very challenging. 
With the exception of the exceptional third-floor roundabout above mixed traffic in Bogotá as mentioned 
in the previous section, there are no other readily available examples of an aesthetically acceptable 
flyover.
