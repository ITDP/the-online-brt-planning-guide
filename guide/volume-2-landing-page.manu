Volume 2 runs through the necessary preparations and calculations needed to plan out the operations of the BRT project in order to optimize its service frequency, capacity, and ridership.

This requires surveying occupancy, boarding, and alighting in order to assess transport demand, whether through data aggregation or modeling software as discussed in Chapter 4. Using this information the project team can then analyze the demand of multiple corridors in Chapter 5, and they can evaluate necessary factors from land use and time savings to economic and political costs.

After analyzing what the overall BRT project might look like, Chapters 6 and 7 go deeper into fleshing out the service plan of the project, using technical equations that evaluate station saturation, travel time, direct services, trunk-and-feeder services, frequency, headways, vehicle sizing, speed, and capacity among other details.

Finally, Chapter 8 provides the guidance needed to assess the traffic impacts of the project given this service plan.
