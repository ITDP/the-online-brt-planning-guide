The BRTMC area itself requires specific spatial features. Sufficient space should be allowed for the
following areas: control room; open-plan environments; offices; meeting rooms; rest and recreation areas
and a cafeteria; ablution facilities, storage space; server and telecommunications room, staging area,
vault space, UPS and generator rooms, and walkway space.

\subsection{Control Room}

This area should accommodate the following groups:
\item Operations control operators and supervisor;
\item Surveillance operators and supervisor;
\item Call center agents and supervisor.

The size of the area depends on the number of workstations required. As a BRT system is likely to be
developed in phases, the control room will most likely be only partially utilized during the initial
years. However, it is imperative to plan for future requirements where applicable.

Each BRTMC operator will require space for a computer terminal, voice communications equipment, and
additional work space. The number of operator workstations required for the total system is a factor
of the size of the system and the number of vehicles each operator can safely control. The nature of
the controller software package will also play an important role in determining the number of vehicles
a BRTMC staff member can effectively oversee. However, under normal conditions each operator should be
able to manage an average of eighty to one hundred vehicles. Additionally, since the Operators should
be able to clearly communicate with the drivers, the acoustic arrangement of the workstations should
be considered. If noise from one workstation interferes with the communications in another workstation,
there could be a potential for lost or misinterpreted communications, which might be problematic.

By using a video wall displaying critical junctures in the system and the positions of the various
vehicles, these staff members would be provided with a visual understanding and assessment of the system’s
operations. A video wall would also help in circumstances where multiple staff members need to resolve
a complex issue together.

\subsection{Open-Plan Environments}

Open-plan work spaces, separate from one another, are recommended for the following areas:
\number AFC Operators and Supervisor;
\number Safety and Security Officers and Supervisor, plus Law Enforcement Representatives;
\number BRT IS&T Contactor;
\number Facility Management.

\subsection{Offices}

A separate office for each manager is recommended.

\subsection{Meeting Rooms}

There should be at least two meeting rooms that can accommodate approximately ten people and one that
can accommodate twenty people. Furthermore, to assist with public relations as well as interactions with
the Media, it is recommended to have a visitor viewing area—that is, an auditorium, overlooking the control
room environment with a clear view of the video wall. Additionally, it is suggested to allow space for
a Joint Operations Center (JOC) where in the event of an emergency situation key personnel from the BRT
team can meet with key staff from various other disciplines, like traffic, police, and emergency service,
to plan and direct emergency operations and recovery. Additionally, this can be a space where any required
media interaction can be conducted to assist in keeping the public informed about the state of affairs
with respect to the emergency situation.

\subsection{Rest and Recreation Areas and a Cafeteria}

Control room operators can become fatigued by long hours of looking at monitors and tracking vehicles.
Holding focused concentration for long periods of time can be mentally exhausting. Typically, operators
should have frequently scheduled breaks in order to maintain their alertness. It is therefore recommended
that there should be a relaxation area or break area that allows operators to refresh themselves. Furthermore,
it is recommended that space be allowed for a cafeteria environment.

\subsection{Ablution Facilities}

It is recommended to not only provide toilets but also shower facilities.

\subsection{Storage Space}

It is recommended to provide a secure room for the storing of equipment and materials.

\subsection{Server and Telecommunications Room}

It is suggested that two environments should be provided for, separate from one another, to accommodate
the following:
\number IT data processing equipment, e.g., servers, Storage Area Network (SAN) equipment, data backup
devices, etc.;
\number Local Area Network (LAN) and PABX equipment.

It is further recommended that these two server rooms should comply with international standards such
as the TIA 942 Data Center Standard.

\subsection{Staging Area}

An environment should be provided where computer and telecommunications equipment can be configured
and set up before they are placed into production.

\subsection{Vault Space}

It is recommended to make allowance for vault space where high-value items and computer/data backup
media can be stored.

\subsection{UPS and Generator Rooms}

Separate areas for housing the Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) and generator equipment, respectively,
are recommended.

\subsection{Other Utility Rooms}

It is proposed that separate areas for the following might also be required:
\number Municipal power connection to the building’s high-voltage plant;
\number Telecommunication service provider’s equipment—Wide Area Network (WAN) connection point;
\number Fire suppression room to house gas bottles (e.g., FM 200 gas cylinders) and related equipment;
\number Air-conditioning plant.

\subsection{Walkway Space}

Walkway space should constitute approximately 25 percent of utilized space.
