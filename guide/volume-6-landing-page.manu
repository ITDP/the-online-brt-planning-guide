Volume 6 provides detailed guidance on the physical infrastructure that are required of a BRT system as well as their management and costs.  Depending on the context of the corridor for the project, the roadway may need to be altered to accommodate dedicated BRT lanes.

Additionally, there are a number of station configurations specific to varying widths and rider demand. Plus the station and terminal designs need consideration in order to provide a comfortable, functional, and easy boarding and alighting process for customers.

At each intersection there are potential conflicts with motor vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of the road, and in order for BRT vehicles to maintain a high frequency, the traffic signals will need to be created or retrofitted with transit signal priority to give preference to the BRT.

The vehicles themselves need to be stored, repaired, and deployed from depots, which require careful planning in order to best fit and arrange the vehicles spatially.

Finally, the control center should be planned carefully in order to have oversight and the potential to adapt to changing traffic conditions and respond to a wide variety of emergencies.
