> The world is not to be put in order. The world is order. It is for us to put ourselves in unison with this order.
@ Henry Miller, writer, 1891–1980

For a BRT system that operates for a longer period than normal office hours, it might be required to 
implement a shift system. In this case there would, however, still be some groups in the BRTMC that would 
not be required to work outside normal office hours.

\subsection{Shift Systems}

As discussed earlier, to comply with local labor laws—that is, maximum hours an employee may work per 
month, etc.—it might be required in the case of a BRT system that operates from say 06:00 to 21:00 (i.e., 
for sixteen hours per day) to have staff for three shifts. One team will be off while two teams each 
work a shift. Also, for critical shift functions where a full-time human presence is required, at least 
two staff would be required per shift to perform these functions, because time should be allowed for 
a shift worker to take breaks and to eat.

It is recommended that the following staff should perform shift work (two shifts per day should be 
adequate for a BRT system that operates for sixteen hours per day as mentioned above, i.e., 05:30 to 
13:30 and 13:30 to 21:30):

\number Operations Control: Driver and Vehicle Scheduling Officer; Monitoring and Schedule Adherence Operators 
and Supervisor;
\number Automatic Fare Collection: AFC Monitoring, Scheduling, and Schedule Adherence Operators and Supervisor;
\number Safety and Security: Surveillance Operators and Supervisor, plus Police and Traffic Police Liaison 
Officers;
\number Call Center: Call Center Agents, Supervisors, and Web Administrator.

It is recommended that the managers of these groups work standard office hours.

Additionally, it is proposed that the outsourced security service should provide the required on-site 
security personnel on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis.

\subsection{Operational Procedures}

For the BRTMC to function optimally, it is imperative to not only provide the staff with the necessary 
equipment, but also clear instruction on what to do, when, where, and why. Clear operational procedures 
that empower the staff to perform their jobs are therefore vital to the success of the BRTMC. 

The BRTMC workflow specification should detail the collective flow of actions over four main functions. 

The four main functions of the BRTMC are:

\item Collect data/info;
\item Configure the data/info;
\item Share data/info with all the relevant stakeholders;
\item Monitor performance, safety, and security.

Operational procedures are required to explain how events would trigger specific actions by certain 
stakeholders to enable the flow of data and information through the system. It would also specify how 
reports are to be generated. Operational procedures and protocol would provide instructions on how the 
operator would act when receiving calls, where to find information, and what to do with it. From a management 
perspective, workflow would detail how informational meaning may be derived from certain views of data 
and what options could be followed to ensure it flows through the communication system to its proper 
destination(s).

The general Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that should be developed include:

\item Incident detection;
\item Incident response management;
\item Incident confirmation;
\item Maintenance request generation;
\item Performance management monitoring;
\item Station monitoring;
\item Vehicle monitoring;
\item Safety and security monitoring;
\item AFC monitoring;
\item Power failure;
\item Smoke/fire in TMC actions;
\item Security in TMC;
\item Request for video footage;
\item BRTMC evacuation plan;
\item BRTMC disaster recovery and business continuity.

\subsection{Operational Scenarios}

Three operational scenarios of how the BRT system should work once operational are sketched below to 
provide a better understanding of the role that the BRTMC plays in the operations of the BRT system. 

\subsubsection{Customer Scenario}

\figure{assets/image12.jpeg}{A customer uses the fare system at a BRT station in Bangkok, Thailand.}{ITDP.}

Sipho needs to use the BRT system, because he has a meeting in town A’s central business district (CBD) 
at 09:00. Sipho logs on to the Internet and views the BRT website, which is administered by the BRTMC’s 
call center, to determine if the vehicle schedule is on time. The website indicates that all vehicles 
are running on time. 

Sipho uses a feeder bus to trunk station Alpha. Arriving at the trunk station, Sipho realizes that 
his BRT smart card does not have enough money in order for him to make a trip. At the ticket kiosk, Sipho 
reloads his smart card with enough credit to travel the rest of the week. At the gate, Sipho touches 
his card and gains access to the station.

\figure{assets/image13.jpeg}{A message board shows departure times of vehicles in Chengdu, China.}{

Sipho looks at the time and sees that the Verbal Message Sign (VMS), which is also administered from 
the BRTMC, indicates that the next express vehicle traveling to town A’s CBD will arrive in five minutes. 
Sipho decides to buy a newspaper at the newsstand while waiting for the vehicle. 

The Automatic Voice Annunciator (AVA), again administered from the BRTMC, announces that the vehicle 
has arrived. Sipho boards and finds a comfortable seat. The VMS on the vehicle and the AVA announcing 
each station provide Sipho with the comfort to read his newspaper. The vehicle priority allows the vehicle 
to clear slow-moving traffic at the intersection. The VMS display and the AVA annunciator warn Sipho 
that his station is up next. Sipho gathers all his belongings and disembarks the vehicle at the station.

Sipho exits the station again through the gate and walks the two blocks to where his meeting is scheduled. 
Sipho arrives at his meeting on time, relaxed, and without the morning stress of traffic. Figure 27.15 
illustrates the movement of the customer scenario as sketched above.

\subsubsection{Maintenance Scenario}

\figure{assets/image16.jpeg}{Station officer at the card readers in a Bogotá, Colombia, BRT station. 
}{Karl Fjellstrom, Far East BRT.}

Vuzi is the station officer at one of the trunk stations. One of Vuzi’s duties is to check all equipment 
at the station before operations start and determine if anything is broken and needs to be repaired.

Vuzi arrives at the station and starts to check the equipment. Vuzi first assesses the gates and finds 
that one of the card readers at the gates is faulty. Vuzi makes a note and continues the inspection. 
Vuzi checks the Passenger Display Units (PDUs) and AVA and all of them are functioning correctly. Vuzi 
continues with the assessment of the ticketing kiosks and finds that all is in order as well. Vuzi checks 
the automatic doors that allow access to the vehicles and finds that they are faulty. All the other equipment 
is in order.

Vuzi then contacts the BRTMC immediately and reports to the call center agent that one of the card 
readers at the gate is not working and that the automatic doors are faulty.

Gareth is the call center agent on duty and logs the call received from Vuzi. Gareth immediately dispatches 
the card reader and automatic door maintenance teams. They indicate that the problem will be fixed within 
the hour. 

The respective maintenance personnel arrive at the station where Vuzi shows them the problems. They 
fix the problems and report to Vuzi who goes to inspect the card reader and automatic doors and finds 
them fixed. 

The maintenance staff and Vuzi report back to Gareth at the BRTMC that all faulty equipment has been 
fixed, and Gareth completes the logged call with a short report.

Figure 27.17 illustrates the maintenance scenario as described above.

\subsubsection{Emergency Scenario}

Dillon and Cynthia are operators working for the Safety and Security group in the BRTMC’s control room. 
Both of them have been on duty for only two hours, and they are comfortably watching the monitors. 

Dillon sees on one of the monitors that something has happened that is out of the ordinary. There is 
an accident at an intersection involving one of the BRT vehicles and a car. Dillon immediately logs a 
call to fire and rescue stating that an accident has occurred at the Nelson and Main Street intersection 
and that it involves a BRT vehicle and a car. While Dillon is logging the call to the fire and rescue, 
Cynthia logs a call to the police in case there are any fatalities. The fire and rescue department and 
the police immediately dispatch vehicles to the accident scene. 

Once Dillon has completed his call to fire and rescue, he contacts the Traffic Department to dispatch 
personnel to manage the other traffic. Cynthia has the responsibility to inform the Operations Control 
group in the BRTMC to reschedule/relocate vehicles and update all VMS at stations. Operations Control 
informs all station officers and the depot manager of the current standings and contacts the web administrator 
at the call center to update the information on the website.

The entire time that the accident cleaning process is under way, Dillon and Cynthia review the CCTV 
cameras. Once the clean-up operation is complete, the vehicles are rescheduled, and operations can continue 
normally.

Figure 27.18 illustrates the emergency scenario as described above.
