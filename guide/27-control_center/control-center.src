>Everyone in a complex system has a slightly different interpretation. The more interpretations we 
gather, the easier it becomes to gain a sense of the whole.
@Margaret J. Wheatley, writer and management consultant, 1944–


*Overview*


A centralized management and control of the BRT system affords many advantages to optimize system efficiencies 
and minimize costs: 

\item Immediate response to changes in customer demand;

\item Immediate response to equipment failures, safety, and security problems;

\item Efficient spacing between BRT vehicles and avoidance of vehicle “bunching”;

\item Automated system performance evaluation;

\item Automated linkages between operations and revenue distribution;

\item Efficient response to customer queries.


In the case of many conventional bus service operators, vehicle fleets are often depleted, old, and 
not adequately adapted to existing infrastructure and operational needs, like accommodating the disabled.
