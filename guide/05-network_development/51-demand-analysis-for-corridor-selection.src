The most important factor in determining whether a corridor is appropriate for BRT investments is the 
existing level of public transport demand. This is because the existing customers using a particular 
corridor are more than likely going to benefit from new BRT investments. A BRT built on a corridor with 
more existing transit customers is likely to have more beneficiaries than a BRT built on a corridor with 
fewer existing customers. 

The methods for determining the existing level of transit ridership on a corridor are reviewed at length 
in Chapter 4: Demand Analysis. For the corridor selection process, the methodologies identified in Section 
4.4 under “Basic Methodologies for Demand Analysis” offer a sufficient level of detail to make a simple 
determination of which corridors would benefit most from BRT.

Some planners have attempted to determine a minimum level of existing demand below which dedicating 
a lane exclusively to buses is difficult to justify. *The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual* 
(TCQSM), a guide generally used in the United States, recommends that a minimum ridership of 1,200 passengers 
per direction at the peak hour (ppdph) be a minimum threshold for an exclusive bus lane, as this is a 
reasonable average estimate for the number of customers that are generally able to use the lane when 
operating in mixed traffic conditions. In developing countries with much higher levels of transit ridership, 
it is likely that a higher minimum threshold would be set.

flows, fairly accurately reflected in the bus flows illustrated. The southeastern phase 3 extension is 
to a new area currently under construction. Note also that phases 1 and 2 both provide downtown, city 
center access. Map}{ ITDP.}

This guide does not mandate a minimum threshold of 1,200 existing bus or minibus pphpd, recognizing 
that there could be significant latent demand for high-speed transit in highly congested corridors or 
corridors with high rates of land development along them. The guide does recommend, however, that whatever 
the existing demand, at least a thousand pphpd should be attainable within the first year of BRT operations. 
Indeed, *The BRT Standard *(2014) deducts maximum points for systems that do not reach this. It should 
be possible to estimate demand for BRT during the first year of operation through a combination of existing 
bus or minibus demand, and some indication that there is likely to be new land development in the corridor, 
that congestion is likely to worsen significantly in the medium term, or that high existing bus, minibus, 
or rail demand in nearby corridors would shift due to overall travel time improvements.

Other planners have claimed that BRT as a technology cannot handle more than thirty-five thousand ppphd, 
so if a corridor has a projected number of customers greater than this then it should be reserved for 
heavy rail metro investments. Again, this guide does not make a specific recommendation of this type. 
Under certain conditions, BRT systems are able to carry more than thirty-five thousand pphpd even with 
only two lanes of exclusive bus lanes per direction. For example, TransBrasil is scheduled to open by 
the end of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. This corridor is expected to carry up to sixty thousand customers 
during peak hour, due to extensive use of express services, two lanes per direction, and larger buses, 
such as articulated and biarticulated buses. 

This guide recommends that the existing transit ridership data be presented to stakeholders in transparent 
form, ideally on a map with link by link loads.

Guangzhou Avenue routes operate, feature more than 150 buses per hour in a single direction.}{ ITDP.}
