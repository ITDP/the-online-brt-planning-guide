The basis for the cost-benefit analysis of corridor length is typically the time savings generated 
by the exclusive busway. Once the exclusive busway no longer provides a net time savings benefit in comparison 
to the construction costs, then the point has been reached when the exclusive busway is no longer cost 
justifiable. As the number of customers falls with the distance from the city center, the total time 
savings benefit is reduced. Further, since congestion levels will also likely fall with distance from 
the city center, the travel-time advantage of an exclusive busway will likewise fall. Table 5.3 provides 
an example of a cost and benefit analysis plotted against a corridor’s length.

Of course, this time savings benefit will tend to increase as congestion worsens over time. Since a 
BRT system is likely to last a long time, it is standard practice to roughly estimate the likely congestion 
along the corridor in the next ten to twenty years rather than simply assuming that current congestion 
conditions will prevail long into the future.

In the example given in Table 5.1, the corridor would end after segment “H” if the decision was based 
only on benefit to cost considerations. After segment “H,” the benefit to cost ratio falls below a value 
of one, meaning that the costs of extending the exclusive busway corridor outweigh the time savings benefits.

\subsection{Where to Build Infrastructure Versus Where to Run BRT Services}

Modern thinking in BRT planning has evolved to separate BRT infrastructure from BRT services in such 
a way that BRT services may operate both on- and off-corridor in a way that optimizes customer benefits 
versus infrastructure cost. Therefore, in the sections above, “BRT corridor” refers directly to the infrastructure 
built on a segment of road, rather than to the services that are needed. 

Once a corridor has been selected, it is important to make an informed judgment regarding where to 
design BRT infrastructure and for how long of a stretch. This is best done by graphing the demand distribution 
and speeds during the peak hour, and selecting the location with both the highest demand and lowest speeds. 
Per the definition of BRT, the selected corridor must be at least 3 kilometers.

Building BRT infrastructure on the segment of roadway along the corridor with the highest demand means 
that infrastructure investment will yield the greatest benefits. Oftentimes, however, the sections of 
a corridor with the highest demand are precisely the sections where politicians are less willing to propose 
BRT infrastructure, as those sections often face more constraints. As a result, BRT infrastructure often 
stops just before the segment where it is needed most. *The BRT Standard *(2014) awards maximum points 
to corridors that include the highest quality of BRT infrastructure on the highest demand segment. This 
often means extending the BRT directly into the city center. For other corridors that do not come near 
the city center, this may simply mean the area with higher demand than the rest of the city.

Once the location for BRT infrastructure has been selected, one must consider what to do beyond the 
infrastructure. Many cities propose lower-quality bus treatments beyond the infrastructure. Generally, 
however, it is preferable to allow BRT services to simply enter mixed traffic beyond the infrastructure. 
This sends a clear signal to the public that there is a difference between BRT and everything else, and 
leaves open the possibility of building out the rest of the corridor as full BRT at a later date. If 
lower-quality bus treatments are implemented beyond the BRT infrastructure, it is less likely that they 
will ever be upgraded to full BRT.

Finally, it is possible to design BRT services to extend beyond the BRT infrastructure into many parts 
of the city. This expands the catchment area of the BRT to many more beneficiaries than simply a service 
that directly matches the infrastructure. It also provides an opportunity to bring new BRT services to 
sections of the city where no bus services previously existed but where stakeholders wished to see a 
BRT corridor. That is, in some cases, during the corridor selection process, some selection of stakeholders 
may advocate for a corridor with no preexisting bus demand. It is unlikely that such a corridor will 
make it to the list of top corridors for BRT implementation. However, if the requested corridor is located 
near the corridor ultimately selected, it may be reasonable to run a service into that area to begin 
to grow demand for future BRT infrastructure in that location, as well as to demonstrate to stakeholders 
that such an area will be a beneficiary of BRT.

The next chapter covers how to develop and optimize a BRT service plan. But it is worth noting here 
that a BRT corridor with multiple services receives maximum points on *The BRT Standard *(2014).
