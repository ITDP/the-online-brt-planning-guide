> Many roads lead to the path, but basically there are only two: reason and practice.
@ Bodhidharma, Buddhist monk, 6th century

Once both existing ridership and existing speed data have been mapped, the two datasets can be overlaid 
so that there is one map showing where high demand and low speeds overlap. This is a good indication 
of where BRT is likely to have the most impact.

with thicker lines, while low speeds are depicted in red.}{ ITDP.}

From here, potential corridors should be delineated. Per the definition of a BRT corridor, a corridor 
must be at least 3 kilometers in length. It is rare that one single corridor will have uniform ridership 
and speeds along its full length. Therefore, corridors must be selected by choosing 3 kilometer or longer 
continuous segments of roadway with relatively consistent demand and speed values. This requires some 
judgment on the part of the planner, and ideally some knowledge of the city. It may make sense to draw 
corridors along existing bus routes, but it is not necessary since bus routes may enter and exit corridors, 
so BRT infrastructure might also be built along segments of routes.

corridors for BRT in Greater Boston are highlighted on the map.} {ITDP.}

Once corridors have been identified, they should be ranked from highest demand to lowest demand, with 
a minimum threshold that planners believe can still reasonably bring the corridor up to 1,000–1,200 pphpd 
in the first year of operation. Each corridor should be color-coded based on its average speed. Those 
corridors with unusually high speeds for the region should be screened out, as they are likely already 
functioning at a relatively high efficiency. Additionally, those corridors on which another public transport 
project is currently being planned should also be screened out.

In many parts of the world, demand far surpasses these minimums. In such cases, it is generally reasonable 
to select the top ten corridors based on demand, as these are the corridors on which BRT is likely to 
have the most impact. In fact, *The* *BRT Standard* (2014) awards maximum points for corridors that are 
located in the city’s ten corridors with the highest demand.

will be around eighty buses per hour in a single direction, assuming fifty-customer maximum capacity 
buses are utilized.}{ ITDP.}

If stop-by-stop boarding and alighting data is available, it is also a good idea to map boarding and 
alighting volumes along the corridors. The larger the concentration of boardings and alightings along 
a corridor, the greater the likelihood that a BRT will be beneficial. Boarding and alighting can be used 
as a third metric for determining which corridors BRT could provide the most benefits.

With the top corridors ranked based on existing ridership and speed, we can assume that if any of them 
are upgraded to BRT, the ridership will increase due to the higher speed and attractiveness of the BRT 
as compared to the current bus routes or other options. In the first year of operation, it is reasonable 
to expect an increase of 30 percent above existing ridership. Unless ample resources are available to 
build a model, looking at existing conditions only is generally a reasonable means of determining which 
corridors are best suited for BRT and what kinds of ridership to expect in the opening year.

If a good set of corridors already exists based on this methodology, it is generally enough to build 
a BRT network plan. But sometimes, for political reasons, other corridors without existing bus routes, 
or with existing bus routes but with low demand, are desirable for BRT. In these cases, a costlier and 
more resource-intensive study must be undertaken in order to estimate demand on such a corridor and to 
insert it into the rank order with the other corridors already prioritized.
