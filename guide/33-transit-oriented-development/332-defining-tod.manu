\quotation{ Development has become something to be opposed, instead of welcomed; people move out to the suburbs to make their lives, only to find they are playing leapfrog with bulldozers. They long for amenities that are not eyesores, just as they long to give their kids the experience of a meadow, that child’s paradise, left standing at the end of a street. Many communities have no sidewalks, and nowhere to walk to, which is bad for public safety, as well as for our nation’s physical health. It has become impossible in such settings for neighbors to greet one another on the street, or for kids to walk to their own nearby schools. A gallon of gas can be used up just driving to get a gallon of milk. All of these add up to more stress for already overstressed family lives.}
{Al Gore, former United States Vice President, 1948-}

\subsection{ TOD Defined }

TOD is land development that is specifically designed to integrate, work with, and prioritize the use 
of public transport for daily urban mobility needs. Mere closeness to public transport stations is not 
sufficient for a development to qualify. TOD specifically denotes a proactive orientation towards public 
transport through particular land use and design characteristics known to facilitate and prioritize walking, 
cycling, and other non-motorized and intermediary modes of access to the stations. Key attributes of 
TOD include the optimized development intensity and land-use mix within the walkable zone around the 
public transport stations; a complete, easily accessed, well-connected, and well-protected system of 
walkways; safe cycling and secure cycle parking conditions; and the minimization of the impact of vehicular 
traffic and parking. When synthesized through high quality design, these elements have been proven to 
result in attractive and successful urban forms, where access to public transport is short, easy, pleasant, 
and safe, and eventually, the public transport supports a high and sustained ridership at stations (Europe’s 
Vibrant New Low Car(bon) Communities, ITDP).

Research in both developed and developing countries shows that the combination of raised density, mixed 
land use, street connectivity, and walkability improvements reduces automobile travel and increases both 
non-motorized and public transport travel per capita. (Kenworthy and Laube, 1999; Ewing, Pendall and 
Chen, 2002; Mindali, Raveh and Salomon, 2004; and Litman, 2004). For example, residents of the most urbanized 
neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon, USA, have been shown to use public transport about eight times as 
much, walk six times as much, and drive only about half as much as residents of the least urban areas.

In order to understand relationship between transport and the urban environment, some basic principles 
were needed to explain on what this intersection depends. ITDP distilled eight basic principles of sustainable 
and equitable transport in urban life which form the core definition of TOD (Our Cities Ourselves: Principles 
for Transport in Urban Life, ITDP):

Eight basic principles of sustainable and equitable transport in urban life:

\[WALK\] - Develop neighborhoods that promote walking

\[CYCLE\] - Prioritize non-motorized transport networks 

\[CONNECT\] - Create dense networks of streets and paths 

\[TRANSIT\] - Locate development near high-quality public transport

\[MIX\] - Plan for mixed use 

\[DENSIFY\] - Optimize density and transit capacity 

\[COMPACT\] - Create regions with short commutes 

\[SHIFT\] - Shift away from car dependency and increase mobility by regulating the use and reducing 
the supply of parking and roadway space.

to create inclusive and sustainable communities and cities.}{ ITDP.}

Those principles form the foundation, but still were not enough to understand what this meant in practice. 
To give meaning to what those principles were supposed to achieve and what were the key criteria to achieving 
those, ITDP further developed those principles into *The TOD Standard*, which elaborates a set of key 
performance objectives that are essential to the materialization of these principles, along with a series 
of measurable performance indicators, or metrics, and a scorecard. This can then be used to assess plans 
and designs, station areas, and understand how well a neighborhood or a development is doing when creating 
inclusive transit-oriented and people-oriented places.

Slightly adapted excerpts from *the TOD Standard* introduce the principles and performance objectives 
system that follow in this section. Refer to the original publication for details on metrics and the 
scorecard (\url{www.todstandard.org}).

\subsubsection{Principle 1 | WALK | Develop neighborhoods that promote walking}

Walking is the most natural, healthful, clean, efficient, affordable, and inclusive mode of travel 
to destinations within short distances, and it is a necessary component of virtually every transit trip. 
As such, walking is the foundation for sustainable and equitable access and mobility in a city. Restoring 
it or maintaining it as the primary mode of travel is pivotal to the success of inclusive TOD.  

Walking is also potentially the most enjoyable, safe, and productive way of getting around, if paths 
and streets are attractive, populated, secure, uninterrupted, well protected from vehicular traffic, 
and if useful services and destinations are conveniently located along the way. 

Walking requires moderate physical efforts that are beneficial for most people within reasonable distances 
but can be challenging or infeasible to some when body ability combines with obstacles, steps, or steep 
ramps to form barriers. In the TOD Standard, the terms “walking” and “walkability” should always be understood 
to be inclusive of users of walking or carrying aids, such as wheelchairs, white canes, baby strollers, 
and shopping carts. Complete walkways and crossings must fully support all users in compliance with locally 
applicable or international standards. 

\title{Objective A: The pedestrian network is safe, complete, and accessible to all}

The most basic feature of urban walkability and inclusivity is the existence of a complete, continuous, 
and safe walkway network including safe crossings at desire lines that links origins and destinations 
together and to the local public transit station. The network must be accessible to all persons, including 
older people and people with disabilities, and well protected from motor vehicles. 

\title{Objective B: The pedestrian realm is active and vibrant}

Activity feeds activity. Walking is attractive and secure and can be highly productive when sidewalks 
are populated, animated, and lined with useful ground-floor activities and services, such as storefront 
retail and restaurants. In turn, high foot traffic increases the exposure of local retail outlets and 
services and improves the vitality of the local economy. Visual interior–exterior interactions promote 
security in the pedestrian realm through passive and informal observation and surveillance. All types 
of land uses are relevant to street activation and informal observation—not only shops and restaurants 
but also informal vending, workplaces and residences. 

\title{Objective C: The pedestrian realm is temperate and comfortable}

The general willingness to walk, and the inclusion of people of all bodily abilities, can be significantly 
improved by the provision of shade and other forms of shelter from harsh climate conditions—such as street 
trees, arcades and awnings—or by street orientation that mitigates sun, wind, dust, rain, and snow exposure. 
Trees are the simplest, most effective, and most durable way of providing shade in most climates, and 
they have well-documented environmental and psychological co-benefits. Highly recommended, but not measured 
in this standard, for the sake of simplicity, are amenities such as benches, public toilets, drinking 
fountains, pedestrian-oriented lighting design, wayfinding signage, landscaping, and other street furniture 
and streetscape-enhancing elements.

sit in Nairobi, Kenya.}{ITDP Africa.}

\subsubsection{Principle 2 | CYCLE | Prioritize nonmotorized transport networks}

Cycling is one of the most healthful, affordable, and inclusive mode of urban mobility. It combines 
the convenience of door-to-door travel and the route and schedule flexibility of walking with ranges 
and speeds that compare to or surpass local transit services. Bicycles and other means of people-powered 
transport, such as pedicabs, also activate streets and greatly increase the ridership catchment area 
of transit stations. They are highly efficient and consume little space and few resources. Cycling friendliness 
is therefore a fundamental principle of TOD. Cyclists, however, need protection as they are among the 
road users most vulnerable to crashes with vehicular traffic. Their bicycles are also vulnerable to theft 
and vandalism and require secure parking and storage. The key factors in promoting cycling are thus the 
provision of safe street conditions for cycling and the availability of secure cycle parking and storage 
at all trip origins and destinations and at transit stations. 

\title{Objective A: The cycling network is safe and complete}

A safe cycling network connecting all buildings and destinations by the shortest routes available is 
a basic TOD requirement. Various types of bike infrastructure, including bike paths, bike lanes on roads, 
and slow-traffic streets, can be part of the network. 

\title{Objective B: Cycle parking and storage are ample and secure}

Cycling can be an attractive daily travel option only to the extent that bicycles can be securely parked 
at all destinations, and that bicycles can be secured within private premises at night and for longer 
periods. 

\figure{assets/cycle-curitiba-4-gabriel-oliveira.jpg}{Cycling in Curitiba next to the BRT corridor.}{Gabriel 
T. de Oliveira.}

\subsubsection{Principle 3 | CONNECT}

Short and direct pedestrian and cycling routes require a highly connected network of paths and streets 
around small, permeable blocks. This is primarily important for walking and for public transport station 
accessibility, which can be easily discouraged by detours. A tight network of paths and streets offering 
multiple routes to many destinations can also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable.

Short, direct walking and cycling require dense, well-connected networks of paths and streets around 
short city blocks. Walking in particular can be easily discouraged by detours and is particularly sensitive 
to network density. A tight network of paths and streets that offers multiple routes to many destinations, 
frequent street corners, narrower rights of way, and slow vehicular speed make walking and cycling trips 
varied and enjoyable and invigorate street activity and local commerce. An urban fabric that is more 
permeable to pedestrians and cyclists than to cars also encourages the use of nonmotorized and transit 
modes with all the associated benefits. 

\title{Objective A: Walking and cycling routes are short, direct, and varied}

The simplest proxy for the connectivity of the pedestrian walkway is the size of city blocks, defined 
as sets of contiguous properties that prevent public pedestrian passage. This block definition might 
be distinct from the blocks defined by mapped streets, since open pedestrian paths can exist through 
superblocks and buildings, regardless of public or private property status.

\title{Objective B: Walking and cycling routes are shorter than motor vehicle routes}

Although high pedestrian and cycling connectivity is an important feature of TOD, road connectivity 
enhancing motor vehicle travel is not. An urban fabric that is more permeable to pedestrians and cyclists 
than to cars prioritizes non-motorized and public transport modes and provides safer, nuisance-free route 
options.

safe and prioritized.}{Luc Nadal.}

\subsubsection{Principle 4 | TRANSIT | Locate development near high-quality public transport}

Walkable access to rapid and frequent transit, defined as rail transit or bus rapid transit (BRT), 
is integral to the TOD concept and a prerequisite for TOD Standard recognition. Rapid transit service 
connects and integrates pedestrians with the city beyond walkable and cycling ranges and is critical 
for people to access the largest pool of opportunities and resources. Highly efficient and equitable 
urban mobility and dense and compact development patterns mutually support and reinforce each other. 


Rapid public transit plays an important role not only in providing quick and efficient trips but also 
in weaving into other frequent and alternative transit options for a complete transit network. These 
transit options support the entire spectrum of urban transport needs and may come in various modes, including 
low- and high-capacity vehicles, taxis and motorized rickshaws, bi-articulated buses, and trains.

\title{Objective: High-quality public transport is accessible by foot}

For TOD Standard status, the maximum acceptable walking distance to the nearest rapid transit station 
is defined as 1,000 meters and 500 meters for a frequent local bus service that connects to a rapid transit 
network within less than 5 kilometers. The transfer station should be designed for short, convenient 
and all-accessible connections with the rapid transit service.

for creating inclusive TOD.}{Liu Xianwei.}

\subsubsection{Principle 5 | MIX | Plan for mixed uses, income, and demographics}

When there is a balanced mix of complementary uses and activities within a local area (i.e., a mix 
of residences, workplaces, and local retail commerce), many daily trips can remain short and walkable. 
Diverse uses peak at different times and keep local streets animated and safe. They encourage walking 
and cycling activity, support extended hours of transit service, and foster a vibrant and complete human 
environment where people want to live. People of all ages, genders, income levels, and demographic characteristics 
can safely interact in public places. A mix of housing options makes it more feasible for workers of 
all income levels to live near their jobs and helps prevent lower-income residents dependent on lower-cost 
public transit from being systematically displaced to poorly-served outlying areas. Inbound and outbound 
commuting trips are more likely to be balanced during peak hours and throughout the day, resulting in 
more-efficient transit systems and operations. The two performance objectives for the MIX Principle therefore 
focus on the provision of a balance of complementary activities and land uses and on a diverse mix of 
resident income levels and demographic attributes.

\title{Objective A: Opportunities and services are within a short walking distance of where people live and 
work, and the public space is activated over extended hours}

To allow many daily trips to be short and walkable, inbound and outbound transit trips to be balanced, 
and neighborhoods to be active and secure day and night. A mix of uses, services, and incomes helps ensure 
vibrant and inclusive. If an area has only one type of use, or a heavily dominant use such as office 
buildings in a business district, the best contribution is to bring new uses and activities that help 
counterbalance that dominance. Development for locating in, or contributing to, complete neighborhoods, 
also needs to ensure that access to local sources of fresh food, primary schools, and healthcare facilities 
or pharmacies. Fresh food is not only a necessity of daily life, but—equally importantly—a reasonably 
simple-to-assess and reliable litmus test for the wider availability of basic supplies, because it has 
more rigorous supply chain requirements than nonperishable necessities. Very different processes govern 
the provision of primary schools and local healthcare services, which are essential local services especially 
important to poor households. Being able to walk to school, of course, carries health and cost benefits 
for all. Public parks and playgrounds have multiple benefits—from improved air quality, to reduced heat 
island effects, to the increased physical and mental health and comfort of residents. Access to parks 
and playgrounds is particularly important to the urban poor, who have little access to private facilities 
and few opportunities to break away temporarily from urban life

\title{Objective B: Diverse demographics and income ranges are included among local residents}

Social equity is no less important to long-term sustainability than reduced environmental footprints. 
Mix of incomes is as important to mix of activities and uses to achieve more equitable and sustainable 
communities and cities. *The TOD Standard* promotes social equity not only through inclusive access and 
mobility but also through inclusionary housing and its equitable distribution over the different areas 
of the city. The Standard also promotes upgrading substandard informal housing in situ, where safe, and 
generally promotes the protection of residents and communities from involuntary displacement caused by 
redevelopment. One goal is to avoid creating neighborhoods that reinforce social separation and the concentration 
of poverty. Another goal is to avoid displacement, which is extremely detrimental to communities. Involuntary 
displacement leads to the breaking of community ties, the destruction of social capital and networks, 
and the loss of access to familiar resources and local employment opportunities.

\subsubsection{Principle 6 | DENSIFY | Optimize density and match transit capacity}

A dense model of development is essential to serving future urban development with transit that is 
sufficiently rapid, frequent, well connected, and reliable at most hours to ensure a satisfactory life 
free of dependence on cars and motorcycles. Urban density is needed to both accommodate growth within 
the inherently limited areas that can be served by quality transit and to provide the ridership that 
supports and justifies the development of high-quality transit infrastructure. From this perspective, 
urban areas must be designed and equipped not only to accommodate more people and activities per hectare 
than is usually the case in this age of vehicle-oriented sprawl but also to support highly desirable 
lifestyles. 

Transit-oriented density results in well-populated, lively, active, vibrant, and secure places, where 
people want to live. It delivers the customer base and the foot traffic that makes local commerce thrive 
and supports a wide choice of services and amenities. Densification should generally be encouraged to 
the full extent that it is compatible with daylighting and the circulation of fresh air, access to parks 
and recreational spaces, the preservation of natural systems, and the protection of historic and cultural 
resources. As many of the most well-loved neighborhoods in great cities around the world attest, high-density 
living can be highly attractive. The challenge is to generalize the best aspects of urban density at 
an affordable cost, mobilize the resources to make it happen with appropriate infrastructure and services, 
and reform the frequent bias of land use codes and other development policy frameworks toward low densities. 
And a combination of residential and nonresidential density is needed in support of high-quality transit, 
local services, and vibrant public spaces. 

\title{Objective A: High residential and job densities support high-quality transit, local services, and 
public space activity}

Transit-oriented density results in well-populated streets, ensuring that station areas are lively, 
active, vibrant, and safe places where people want to live. Density delivers the customer base that supports 
a wide range of services and amenities and makes local commerce thrive. The limits to densification should 
result from requirements for access to daylight and circulation of fresh air to living rooms and workplaces; 
access to parks and open space; preservation of natural systems; and protection of historic and cultural 
resources. This objective measures both of residential and commercial densities.

\figure[medium]{assets/image29.jpg}{An example of a dense, active, and pleasant neighborhood.}{Luc Nadal.}

\subsubsection{Principle 7 | COMPACT| Create regions with short transit commutes}

The basic organizational principle of TOD is compactness: having all necessary components and features 
fitted close together, conveniently and space-efficiently. With shorter distances, compact cities require 
less time and energy to travel from one activity to another, need less extensive and costly infrastructure 
(though higher standards of planning and design are required), and preserve rural land from development 
by prioritizing the densification and redevelopment of previously developed land. The COMPACT Principle 
can be applied on a neighborhood scale, resulting in spatial integration by good walking and cycling 
connectivity and orientation toward transit stations. On the scale of a city, compact means the city 
is covered and integrated spatially by public transit systems. 

\title{Objective A: The development is in, or next to, an existing urban area}

Development should take place on sites within or at the immediate edge of an existing urbanized area, 
particularly through the efficient use of vacant, previously developed lots, such as brownfields. 

\title{Objective B: Traveling through the city is convenient}

Development should prioritize areas that offer diverse public transport options and easy commute time 
to the closest major center of employment and specialized urban services. Developers and project promoters 
have control over this aspect when making location decisions in the early stage of projects. 

\figure{assets/image30.jpg}{Infill development is preferable to expanding into greenfields 
where possible.}{Will Collin via Flickr.}

\subsubsection{Principle 8 | SHIFT | Increase mobility by regulating parking and road use}

In cities shaped by the above seven principles, the use of personal motor vehicles in day-to-day life 
becomes unnecessary for most people, and the various detrimental side effects of such vehicles can be 
drastically reduced. Scarce and valuable urban space resources can be reclaimed from unnecessary roadways 
and parking and reallocated to more socially and economically productive uses. Conversely, a gradual 
but proactive reduction of roadways and parking space availability in urban space is needed to lead to 
a shift in transport mode shares from private motor vehicles to the more sustainable and equitable modes, 
if matched by sufficient walking, cycling, public transit, and occasional support vehicles.

\title{Objective: The land occupied by motor vehicles is minimized}

Off-street and on-street parking space for motor vehicles should be reduced along with the overall 
street space occupied by traveling motor vehicles. Space should be reallocated to the more economically 
and socially productive uses of public space and sustainable transportation.
