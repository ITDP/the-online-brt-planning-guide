BRT projects seek to optimize one basic parameter: minimizing door-to-door travel time. Thus, to achieve 
that goal, BRT must be designed and planned—including corridor selection, routes and service plan, and 
alternatives—to ensure that:
\item Capacity is sufficient to handle expected customer demand;
\item Waiting and transfer times are reduced by providing frequent service; 
\item Speeds are high, because of reduced delay at stations; ideally, average speeds should be above 
20 kph in areas with frequent intersections, 25 kph where there is little mixed traffic interference, 
and above 40 kph for limited-stop services.

The reduction of waiting/transfer times should have been addressed with service planning. The focus 
of this chapter is how to achieve sufficient capacity and high speeds. As the number of vehicles and 
customers increases, the opportunity for bottlenecks and operational problems multiplies. Busway systems 
can be designed to operate at high capacities, but in some cases, high-demand designs have also produced 
relatively slow commercial speeds. For example, prior to the Bogotá TransMilenio system, the busway on 
the Avenida Caracas corridor was able to move more than 30,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd); 
this is less than the current BRT system in the same corridor, but it still exhibits a very high demand. 
However, due to significant congestion, the vehicles only averaged 10 kph. By comparison, the TransMilenio 
BRT system operates at an average commercial speed of approximately 27 kph. 

Assuming that congestion in mixed traffic is ruled out with the creation of a busway, two obvious candidates 
can cause delay in the BRT system: intersections and stations. Unless there is conflict between station 
and intersection design, one should assume that, at intersections, buses would experience a delay similar 
to cars. One can expect that the delay experienced by the BRT at intersections is similar to cars in 
off-peak hours and that BRT will perform better than cars at rush hour. Chapter 24: Intersections and 
Traffic Signals addresses station location in relation to intersection design, reviews station delays 
associated with intersections, and suggests how to improve BRT and car travel times at intersections. 
*If stations are properly designed, they are far more likely to increase BRT speeds.* If not properly 
designed, however, stations may contribute to decreased speeds, as well as decreased capacity in relation 
to a conventional system.

The demand analysis process and demand forecast modelling can help quantify existing public transport 
demand, as well as provide projections of expected demand and growth. A system’s infrastructure should 
be designed for capacities projected at least one decade into the future. The size of the growth cushion 
will depend on how fast a city’s population and mobility needs are increasing. For example, in some rapidly 
urbanizing Chinese cities, growth rates of up to 25 percent are being realized in fewer than five years. 
In such instances, a growth cushion of 50 percent or higher may be appropriate for sizing the system’s 
capacity. In other regions that are already highly urbanized, such as Latin America, growth rates are 
much lower. In Latin American cities, a growth cushion of 25 percent has been used.

Designing a high-capacity and high-speed BRT system does not guarantee that door-to-door travel times 
will be minimized. High-capacity and high-speed services can be achieved simply by eliminating all the 
stops along a BRT corridor, and having service run only between the two terminals. Metro systems are 
often designed with very long distances between station stops in order to increase average speeds and 
capacity. However, this has an adverse impact on door-to-door travel times, as customers will have much 
farther to walk to reach the nearest public transport station. The system’s design therefore must be 
optimized so as to minimize door-to-door travel times for the majority of customers—not just in terms 
of speed and capacity. 

The specific design solutions to achieve high capacity vary widely for different levels of demand. 
For example, a BRT system that only needs to handle a demand of 5,000 passengers per hour per direction 
(pphpd) will be significantly different from a system requiring over 30,000 pphpd (Figure 7.1).

per hour per direction (left photo, Bogotá) is quite different from designing systems with less than 
3,000 pphpd (right photo, Orlando, Florida, USA). Images courtesy of Carlos F. Pardo (left) and Lloyd
