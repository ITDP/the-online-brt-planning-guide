If the highest frequency at a BRT corridor bottleneck is one bus per minute, the rest of the corridor 
will have at most a one bus per minute frequency. Identifying this weak link in the system is the foundation 
for improving capacity and avoiding congestion, which in turn improves travel times. In general, the 
critical factor on a public transport system is\highlight{ }*vehicle congestion at the station*.

The fact that BRT systems are now able to reach speeds and capacities comparable to all but the highest 
capacity metro systems is due to dramatic improvements in vehicle capacity at stations. Other factors 
are also important to reaching these speed and capacity goals, but none are as important as preventing 
docking bay congestion. Many existing BRT systems are burdened with slow operating speeds due to incorrect 
demand projections at particular stations. Poorly designed stations can lead to peak-hour vehicle queues 
that stretch for several hundred meters.

The proper design of a station to prevent congestion is directly related to the concept of *saturation 
level*, usually referred to simply as *saturation*.

The *saturation level* of a docking bay refers to the proportion of time that a vehicle docking bay 
is occupied. A docking bay is the designated area in a BRT station where a vehicle will stop and align 
itself to the boarding platform.

A docking bay might be considered occupied at any given moment, if a bus that wants to position itself 
at that docking bay cannot proceed with the proper maneuver. Therefore, a vehicle is “using” the docking 
bay from the moment its approach will prevent other vehicles from doing the same thing until the moment 
it leaves the area so that another vehicle can approach. The amount of time that any given vehicle occupies 
a docking bay is called dwell time (Td). 

Box 7.1 Sub-Stops and Docking Bays

A schematic view of a station, from *The* *BRT Standard*, shows the components of a station including 
the sub-stops and the docking bays, defined as follows: 
\item *S**ub-stop*: a station subdivision or “module” that includes docking bays and customer circulation 
and waiting areas. One station can have multiple sub-stops that are physically connected. In order for 
multiple sub-stops to function, they typically need overtaking lanes or a functional equivalent such 
as in the “directional” BRT stations used in Lanzhou and Yichang. 
\item *D**ocking bay*: the platform-vehicle interface; this is where the bus pulls up in order to let 
customers on and off.

\figure{assets/image5.jpeg}{Therefore, the saturation of a docking bay (xdock) measured for a certain 
time interval (∆t) would be given by the sum of dwell times of each bus docking (Ti d) during that interval, 
divided by the duration of the interval, as expressed by Equation 7.1.}{FIXME!}

Eq. 7.1 Saturation of a docking bay concept:\' TODO Math: 

xdock =docking bus i in ∆tTi d  ∆t '\

Where:

xdock = Saturation of a docking bay;

∑docking bus i in ∆t Tid = Sum of docking times of buses; ∆t = Time interval.\' TODO Math: 

Calling Td the average dwell time (which is equivalent to assuming that all buses will have the same dwell time Td), saturation would be:xdock = Nbuses in ∆t * T d  ∆t '\

And calculating the saturation for one hour would result in the following equation:

Eq. 7.2 Saturation of a docking bay for one hour:\' TODO Math: 

xdock = Freqdock * T d  3600 sec '\

Where:

xdock = Saturation of a docking bay;

Freqdock = Frequency of buses docking; Td = Dwell time.

The dwell time consists of three separate categories: boarding time, alighting time, and dead time. 
Boarding and alighting times can partially happen simultaneously, depending on the system protocol for 
boarding and alighting. Dead time is the time consumed by a vehicle slowing down when approaching a station, 
opening its doors (and after a variable dwell time for boarding and alighting), closing its doors, and 
then regaining free flow speed. It is also called *fixed dwell time* because it is the part of dwell 
time that does not vary with the number of customers boarding and alighting at each stop, and it usually 
does not vary between stops in a system.

Two elements of the BRT vehicle affect dead time: the rate of vehicle deceleration when approaching 
a stopping bay and the rate of acceleration when departing from a docking bay. Besides the vehicle capabilities 
(power-to-weight and gear relations), the deceleration and acceleration rates often involve a trade-off 
between speed and customer comfort, as well as the ability to properly align the vehicle to the stopping-bay 
interface.

Vehicle size also affects the dead time. In non-congested situations, vehicles typically require ten 
to sixteen seconds to open and close their doors and pull in and out of a station and, when in a queue, 
up to twenty seconds. However, larger vehicles require more time, and additional time between 0.17 to 
0.25 seconds per meter of vehicle is generally required for pulling in and out of the station. For a 
more detailed model, these values need to be calibrated to produce the amount of dead time, but as a 
conservative approach Equation 7.3 can be used.

Eq. 7.3 Impact of vehicle length on dwell time without queue\' TODO Math: 

T0=13+ Lvehicle*0.25 '\

Where:

T0 = Dead time in seconds;

LVehicle = Length of the vehicle in meters.

As for the variable part of dwell time (boarding and alighting time), the main factors affecting it 
include:
\item Customer-flow volumes;
\item Number of vehicle doorways;
\item Width of vehicle doorways;
\item Entry characteristics, e.g., stepped or at-level entry, using all doors or having specific doors 
to board and alight;
\item Open space near doorways (on both vehicle and station sides);
\item Fare collection position, e.g., at the station entrance, at the bus entrance, in the middle of 
the bus;
\item Doorway control system.

BRT systems are able to operate metro-like service in large part due to the ability to reduce total 
stop time to twenty seconds or less. A conventional bus service often requires more than sixty seconds 
for stop time, though the specific time will be a function of the number of customers and other factors. 
In general, dwell times may be somewhat higher during peak periods than nonpeak periods. The increase 
during peak periods is due to the additional time needed to board and alight the higher customer volumes.

In a system where both boarding and alighting happens through all doors, dwell time is given by Equation 
7.4:

Eq. 7.4 Dwell time for one bus with an external fare collection and all-door boarding:\' TODO Math: 

Td=T0+pb*tb+pa*ta '\

Where:

Td = Dwell time for a given bus; 

T0 = Dead time for the given bus; 

tb = Average boarding time per customer;

ta = Average alighting time per customer;

pb = Number of boarding customers at the given bus;

pa = Number of alighting customers at the given bus.

If boarding is made exclusively through different doors than alighting, then the dwell time for a bus 
is given by Equation 7.5:

Eq. 7.5 Dwell time for one bus with specific doors for boarding or alighting:\' TODO Math: 

Td=T0+Maxpb*tb,pa*ta '\

Where: 

Td = Dwell time for a given bus; 

T0 = Dead time for the given bus; 

tb = Average boarding time per customer;

ta = Average alighting time per customer;

pb = Number of boarding customers at the given bus;

pa = Number of alighting customers at the given bus.

Equation 7.6 shows the saturation calculation for the situation where both boarding and alighting occur 
through the same doors.

Eq. 7.6 Calculating the saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval, under external 
fare collection and all door boarding:\' TODO Math: 

x=T0*Nbus+Pb*tb+Pa*ta∆t '\

Where: 

x = Saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval; 

Nbus = Number of vehicles that use the docking bay during the interval (if the time interval is an 
hour it is the usual frequency of services referenced in vehicles per hour);

T0 = Average dead time per bus;

tb = Average boarding time per customer;

ta = Average alighting time per customer;

Pb = Number of boarding customers at docking bay during interval;

Pa = Number of alighting customers at docking bay during interval;

∆t = Time interval duration (this is usually seen as 3,600 since one hour calculation is normally done 
and other times are given in seconds).

The equation shows that for a given demand (number of customers) using a docking bay to board and alight, 
the way to reduce saturation is by minimizing the time needed to board or alight or by reducing the number 
of buses, given that the dead time cannot be significantly reduced. The remaining alternative is to split 
the demand in more docking bays.

To illustrate the saturation calculation, we take the example of a TransMilenio’s, Modulo A2 of Alcalá 
Station (March 8, 2007, data) where between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. there were 62 vehicles stopping, 
975 boarding customers, and 23 alighting customers. The dead time is 15 seconds, boarding time per customer 
is 0.3 seconds, and alighting time per customer is 0.2 seconds. This way, the saturation level between 
7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. can be estimated as:\' TODO Math: 

x=15secvehicle*62 vehicles +975 pax *0.3 secpax +23 pax*0.2 secpax3,600 sec '\\' TODO Math: 

x=930 sec +292.5 sec +4.6 sec3,600 sec= 409 sec3,600 sec=0.11 '\

Understanding saturation is important because queue formation is a function of it.

According to the theory of queues, the expected queue a vehicle faces when approaching a station would 
be given by Equation 7.7

Eq. 7.7 Queue size:\' TODO Math: 

QueueSizedock=0.5(Irrarrival+ Irrdeparture)*xdock2(1-x) '\

Where:

QueueSizedock = Average or expected queueing size at docking bay;

x = Saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval; xdock = Saturation of a docking bay;

Irrarrival = Irregularity of arrivals ();

Irrdeparture = Irregularity of departures ().

The mean of the intervals for arrivals and departures is the headway, and the variance would be similar 
to the variance for boardings and alightings if there were no traffic lights and starting schedules were 
exactly followed. If a service was totally regular, no queues would be expected. The particular case 
when irregularities for arrival and departure are random (Irrarrivals=Irrdepartures=1) would result in 
the queue given by Equation 7.8.

Eq. 7.8 Queue size for random arrivals and random boarding-alighting times (the mean can be known):\' TODO Math: 

QueueSizedock=xdock2(1-x) '\

Where:

QueueSizedock = Average or expected queueing size at docking bay;

xdock = Saturation of a docking bay;

x = Saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval.

For the common irregularities observed in urban busways with high volumes (headways below one minute), 
Equation 7.9, derived from observation, can be used:

Eq. 7.9 Queue size for busways in typical urban conditions:\' TODO Math: 

QueueSizedock=0.7*xdock2(1-x) '\

Where:

QueueSizedock = Average or expected queueing size at docking bay;

xdock = Saturation of a docking bay;

x = Saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval.

The expected (average) waiting time in queue (Tqueue) is given by the queue size multiplied by the 
average headway, as expressed in Equation 7.10:

Eq. 7.10 Time waiting in queue:\' TODO Math: 

Tqueue=QueueSize*Hdwy '\

Where:

Tqueue = Time waiting in queue;QueueSize = Average or expected queueing size;

Hdwy = Average headway.

\figure{assets/image6.jpeg}{The Impact of saturation on vehicle velocity is bigger the closer the stations 
are to each other as each station implies more queueing delay. Image}{ Elebeta.}

A low saturation level or a high level of service means that there are no vehicles queuing at a docking 
bay. A high saturation level means that there will be long queues at docking bays. Therefore, increasing 
station saturation tends to lead to a gradual deterioration of service quality. For saturation levels 
over one (x \> 1), the system is unstable with queues increasing until the demand is reduced after the 
peak period. 

For the previous example, the module of Alcalá station has a low saturation rate (0.11). At this level, 
one should not expect to have congestion problems at the station, as the expected queue size and time 
would be irrelevant:\' TODO Math: 

QueueSize=0.7* xdock2(1-x)= 0.7* 0.112(1-0.11)=0.0095 '\\' TODO Math: 

Tq= QueueSize*hdwy=0.0095 vehicles*162 vehicleshour=0.00153 hour=0.55 sec '\

The decision about which saturation levels can be tolerated in specific locations should be considered 
within the overall design context. However, one must keep in mind that for saturation levels above 0.60 
(or 60 percent), the risk of severe congestion and system breakdown is considerable. For BRT stations, 
40 percent is the maximum accepted for planning purposes, allowing a reasonable safety margin for uncertainties 
in the planning process. That is, the cumulative time that a vehicle is stopped at a station should not 
exceed 40 percent of the total time available in an hour.

Expected station saturation effects on commercial speeds are shown in Figure 7.4. Bogotá’s TransMilenio 
strives to keep the saturation value in the range of 0.35 to 0.45. The Calle 76 station of the TransMilenio 
system illustrates the importance of accurately projecting customer movements and station saturation 
levels. Originally, this critical station was planned for a saturation level of 0.40, but during actual 
operation the saturation reached 0.65 due to an unexpectedly high number of transfers. Similar levels 
of saturation were experienced at Heroes Station (which has subsequently been expanded), where saturation 
was much higher than the 0.40 level anticipated. This experience shows the importance of being somewhat 
conservative by planning for 40 percent station saturation.

When boarding is made through different doors, one could expect saturation to be calculated as given 
by Equation 7.11.

Eq. 7.11 Simplified saturation level of a docking bay where boarding is through specific doors:\' TODO Math: 

x=T0*Nbus+MaxPb*tb,Pa*ta∆t '\

Equation 7.11 works when one of the movements between boarding and alighting is clearly longer or if 
customers arrive at stations in a completely regular fashion between the bus passages (the longer the 
headway the more regular this number is). But if the times for boarding and alighting are similar, then 
there will be a certain number of times when boarding will end first and a certain number of times when 
alighting will end first. If the expected times for each operation were equal, then each operation would 
be expected to end first half of the time.

For a random distribution of boarding and alighting times (where the average times are known), the 
number of occasions that the one operation will be longer than the other is given by Equation 7.12.

Eq. 7.12 Expected occurrence of the shortest time overcoming the longer:\' TODO Math: 

rf1= t1t1+t2 '\

Where:

rf1 = Relative frequency where event 1 is longer than event 2;

 = Average length of distribution of events 1;

 = Average length of distribution of events 2;

Using the Poisson distribution, a discrete probability distribution, for events 1 and 2, where the 
standard deviation is equal to the mean, is assumed. 

If we call the mean boarding time per bus of Tb, with Tb = tb * Pb, and mean alighting time per bus 
of Ta, with Ta = ta * pa, the average dwell time would be given by Equation 7.13.

Eq. 7.13\highlight{ }Saturation level of a docking bay where boarding is through specific doors: \' TODO Math: 

Td=T0+Ta+TbTa+Tb*Tb= T0+Tb+TaTa+Tb* Ta '\

Where:

Td = Average dwell time for all buses on a docking bay; 

To = Average dead time for all buses on a docking bay; 

Ta = Average alighting time for all buses on a docking bay;

Tb = Average boarding time for all buses on a docking bay;

 Relative frequency that boarding will be longer than alighting;

 Relative number of times that alighting will be longer than boarding.

Therefore the saturation for a docking bay where boarding is made through specific doors is given by 
Equation 7.14.

Eq. 7.14 Saturation calculation when boarding is through a specific door:\' TODO Math: 

x=T0*Nbus+Pb*tb+Pa*taPa*ta+Pb*tb*Pa*ta∆t '\

Where: 

x = Saturation level of a docking bay for a given time interval; 

Nbus = Number of vehicles that use the docking bay during the interval (if the time interval is an 
hour it is the usual frequency of services referenced in vehicles per hour);

T0 = Average dead time per bus;

tb = Average boarding time per customer;

ta = Average alighting time per customer;

Pb = Number of boarding customers at docking bay during interval (average boarding time per bus is 
given by Tb = tb \* Pb);

Pa = Number of alighting customers at docking bay during interval (average alighting time per bus is 
given by Ta = ta \* Pa);

∆t = time interval duration (this is usually seen as 3,600 as one hour calculation is normally done 
and other times are given in seconds).

For example, a regular bus stop in front of a children’s hospital in São Paulo, using data from between 
6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on February 2, 2007, is served by two routes with a frequency of four trips per 
hour each. The average number of boardings per vehicle is 4.1, for a total of 33, and the average number 
of alightings per vehicle is 10, for a total of 80. People carrying babies count as one. The average 
time per person for boarding is five seconds, and for alighting it is three seconds, with one wheelchair 
alighting taking around forty-five seconds. The saturation of this stop would be calculated as:\' TODO Math: 

x=T0*Nbus+Pb*tb+Pa*taPa*ta+Pb*tb*Pa*ta∆t '\\' TODO Math:

With the stop being occupied only 12 percent of the time, the average expected queue is 0.012 (each 
hundred arrivals the stop will be used by another bus), and the average queue delay is 5 seconds, as 
calculated below:\' TODO Math: 

QueueSize=0.7* xdock2(1-x)= 0.7* 0.122(1-0.12)=0.0116 '\\' TODO Math: 

Tq= QueueSize*hdwy=0.0116 vehicles*18 vehicleshour=0.001455 hour=5.23 sec '\

\subsection{ Saturation on a Sub-Stop with Many Docking Bays}

The defining characteristic of a sub-stop with two or more docking bays is that a vehicle can leave 
the sub-stop only if the vehicle in front of it has already left. We can assume that if this design is 
under consideration, the saturation for only one docking bay is relatively high, so we may ignore the 
situations where frequency is low and dwell times are short. We are facing something between two extreme 
situations:
\item Low frequencies with many customers boarding and alighting in a terminal-like situation;
\item High frequencies with short dwell time.

Of course, another situation could be when there is a high boarding-alighting demand with high service 
frequencies without the use of overtaking lanes. 

*Same service at all docks*

If the vehicles that dwell at the sub-stop with N docking bays were all serving the same route and 
the vehicles were riding in a platoon (of N vehicles), this would be equivalent to having a longer vehicle 
(like a train): the number of doors would be multiplied by N, both the boarding time and the frequency 
of this longer vehicle would be the original frequency divided by N too, which in this case, saturation 
would be divided by N. 

That is ignoring that the dead time for the “train” would be slightly longer than that of one vehicle 
alone; this difference would not be meaningful considering the lack of precision in the previously proposed 
Equation 7.3 when there is no queue.

But when the bay is congested (i.e., is a queue moving), which is the likely situation when multiple 
docking bays are under consideration, the dead time for the whole convoy would be given by Equation 7.15.

Eq. 7.15 Dead time for convoy:\' TODO Math: 

T0 convoy=13+ 0.25* Lvehicle*0.25+2+ 0.17* Lvehicle*(N-1) '\

Where:

T0 convoy = Dead time in seconds for the whole convoy;

N = Number of vehicles in the convoy;

LVehicle = Length of each convoy vehicle in meters (average vehicle length when vehicles are different).

*Ordered platoon (routes attributed to docks)*

If the routes stopping at the sub-stop are different, but platoons are organized when entering the 
busway (Figure 7.5) always in an order that customers can be positioned on the platform in front of the 
right docking bay, the whole “train” would leave the station once boarding and alighting in the most 
heavily demanded “car” was completed.

If the number of arrivals of customers at the station was regular and equally distributed at all routes, 
the saturation for the sub-stop would be equal to the saturation of the most congested docking bay, when 
an average queue size is N times bigger.

But if the number of customers that arrive at a station to board each route is variable, then an additional 
dwell time must be added to calculate the saturation of the most congested docking bay. To do this, within 
that variability, there is an expected regularity, with the known mean and equal standard deviation value 
of the worst case. This is a situation similar to boarding and alighting through different doors, as 
at certain times the boarding-alighting times of each platform may overcome the others.

Assuming Ti b/a is the average boarding and alighting time calculated for the ith docking bay, if there 
were two docking bays, the average dwell time for the convoy would be given by Equation 7.16.

Eq. 7.16 Average dwell time for two docking bays in a sub-stop:\' TODO Math: 

Td 2bays=T0+T1+T2-11T1+1T2= T0+T1+T2T1+T2* T2 '\

If there are three platforms, the equation (shown in 7.17) gets a bit longer.

Eq. 7.17 Average dwell time for three docking bays in a sub-stop:\' TODO Math: 

Td 3bays=T0+T1+T2+T3 -11T1+1T2-11T1+1T3-11T2+1T3+11T1+1T2+1T3 '\

For four platforms it gets even longer and becomes too impractical and difficult to apply.

Eq. 7.18 Average dwell time for four docking bays in a sub-stop:\' TODO Math: 

Td 4bays=T0+T1+T2+T3+T4 -11T1+1T2-11T1+1T3-11T1+1T4-11T2+1T3-11T2+1T4-11T3+1T4+11T1+1T2+1T3+11T1+1T2+1T4+11T1+1T3+1T4+11T2+1T3+1T4+11T1+1T2+1T3+1T4 '\

Where:

Td N bays = Average dwell time for a sub-stop with N docking bays (equation will have 2N terms);

To = Dead time (given by Equation 7.15);

Ti = Variable dwell time for ith docking bay calculated in isolation (given by Equation 7.4 or 7.13 
minus T0 ).

This equation can be extended to any number of platforms and can be relatively easily implemented by 
an algorithm, but an alternative formula (Equation 7.19) that underestimates saturation by 2 percent 
for each additional docking bay above two can be used for practical purposes.

Eq. 7.19: Practical approximation for average dwell time for N docking bays in a sub-stop:\' TODO Math: 

Td Nbays=T0+ 3N+2*i=1NTi '\

Where:

Td N bays = Average dwell time for a sub-stop with N bays (equation will have 2N terms);

N = Number of vehicles in the convoy;

To = Dead time (given by Equation 7.15);

Ti = Variable dwell time for ith docking bay calculated in isolation (given by Equation 7.4 or 7.13 
without considering T0 there).

\figure{assets/image7.png}{Convoying systems order vehicles when entering the corridor, so they ride 
as “train” and the docking position for every route at the station is fixed, preventing users from running 
up and down the platform. Image}{ Pedro Szász.}

*Unordered vehicles *

If the routes stopping at the sub-stops are different and may arrive in any order, the approximation 
for saturation is the same, but what is observed in reality is that for sub-stops with three or more 
docking bays, a certain quantity of vehicles stops twice to pick up customers that miss the vehicle dwelling 
at the first time. Unless there is operational enforcement for preventing this second stop, this can 
be seen as enforcing bad service.

In a design situation, more than three docking bays without organized convoys should not be proposed. 
If dealing with an existing situation, the safest thing to do is to measure the existing saturation.
