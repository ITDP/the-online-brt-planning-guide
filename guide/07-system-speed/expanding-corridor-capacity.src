\quotation{Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.}
{Freeman Thomas, designer, 1957–}

Various design modifications in BRT services and infrastructure expand the capacity of a BRT system. 
The goal of these modifications is to carry more customers—while minimizing the saturation level at stations—and 
thereby ensuring good service speeds.

\subsection{Increasing the Service Frequency}

The service frequency refers to the number of vehicles per hour. The waiting time between vehicles, 
which is roughly the same idea, is known as the headway. Up to a point, simply increasing the vehicle 
frequency on a BRT corridor can increase the corridor capacity. However, at frequencies of more than 
sixty vehicles per hour, simple BRT corridors with one lane per direction tend to experience an unacceptably 
high level of vehicle bunching, or saturation. Therefore, the designer must turn to other alternatives, 
as discussed in the sections below.

The desired load factor may vary between peak and nonpeak periods. In Bogotá’s TransMilenio system, 
typical load factors are 80 percent for peak periods and 70 percent for nonpeak periods. But as ridership 
levels grow in Bogotá, overcrowding becomes an increasing concern (Figure 7.9).

\subsection{Using Larger Vehicles}

If a corridor is liable to reach saturation by way of the number of vehicles per hour, one solution 
is to increase the size of the vehicles. Replacing regular 12-meter vehicles with articulated 18-meter 
vehicles results in a dramatic increase in capacity—without causing a significant worsening in the saturation 
level. Determining the vehicle size should take into account the costs of vehicle operations against 
waiting times, as discussed in Section 6.4: Optimizing Vehicle Size and Fleet Size. Stations and service 
plan alternatives should adapt to use the optimal size to the required demand.

As has been noted, system designers have many vehicle size options. Table 7.12 summarizes the standard 
vehicle sizes available to system developers. Higher vehicle capacity can, in the right circumstances, 
increase BRT system capacity, but the right vehicle size is not always the largest vehicle. The main 
advantage of larger vehicles stems from reductions in operating costs, especially driver labor costs 
per customer carried. However, in lower-demand corridors, these large vehicles also tend to mean lower 
frequency, and hence longer waiting times for customers.

Increasingly, the 18-meter articulated vehicle is becoming the standard for BRT systems. The Curitiba 
system has utilized the larger bi-articulated vehicles, as have Mexico City’s Insurgentes Avenue and 
TransMilenio in Bogotá. There are several reasons for the current dominance of the articulated vehicles 
(160-customer capacity) over the bi-articulated vehicle (270-customer vehicle):
\item Large numbers of articulated vehicle orders have produced cost savings through economies-of-scale 
in manufacturing;
\item Currently only a few manufacturers offer a bi-articulated vehicle, thus limiting the power of 
competition during the bid process;
\item Heavier weight of bi-articulated vehicles reduces fuel efficiency and ability to accelerate rapidly;
\item Length of bi-articulated vehicles (24 meters) can create difficulties with regard to available 
length of right-of-way at stations.

There may be instances where the operational and physical characteristics of a corridor would make 
a bi-articulated vehicle an appropriate choice. Chapter 20: Vehicles discusses vehicle technology options.


As vehicle length increases, there can be a diminishing return in terms of delivered capacity. If sub-stop 
capacity is reached and vehicle congestion occurs, then the additional capacity may not be fully realized. 
Figure 7.11 gives an example of this effect for a given set of parameters.

up the lane to private vehicles.}{Karl Fjellstrom}

While the vehicle size may optimize costs, very low frequencies can have a perverse effect. First, 
customer frequency translates into reliability, and this is one of the main drivers of transit use. Without 
sufficient frequency and reliability, customers may choose other options, and the system will lose ridership. 
Secondly, car drivers in traffic congestion will become frustrated from seeing an empty busway beside 
them. In turn, motorists will complain that the road is being under-utilized (Figures 7.12 and 7.13). 
Such complaints ultimately undermine political support for future busways. While a headway of a few minutes 
may not seem like a lot of time, a busway with a vehicle passing only every few minutes can appear to 
be empty most of the time. In Quito, pressure from motorist organizations led the national police to 
open up exclusive busway corridors to mixed traffic for a period of time in 2006. This conversion occurred 
despite the fact that each busway lane was moving three to four times the volume of customers as a mixed-traffic 
lane. Nevertheless, the perception of an empty busway next to heavily congested mixed-traffic lanes can 
create political difficulties.

\subsection{Adding Passing Lanes and Multiple Sub-Stops}

Measures such as vehicle size, vehicle-station interface, and doorway widths all contribute to higher-capacity 
and higher-speed systems. However, even together, these measures will likely only produce capacities 
around 9,000 pphpd. Thus, while systems such as those in Curitiba and Quito are high-quality BRT systems, 
their maximum corridor capacities are limited to this value. 

\figure{assets/image25.jpeg}{The use of multiple sub-stops and passing lanes helps minimize vehicle 
congestion in Guangzhou, China. Photo}{ ITDP.}

A key innovation of Bogotá’s TransMilenio system was that more capacity and speed was obtained because 
at each station, instead of having just one sub-stop, there were multiple sub-stops (Figure 7.14). In 
some cases, a single TransMilenio station will host up to three sub-stops (Figure 7.15). Each sub-stop 
represents a different set of services or routes (e.g., local services versus limited-stop services or 
routes with a different final destination). As a result, TransMilenio is able to handle capacities up 
to 45,000 pphpd, and there are good indications that values as high as 50,000 pphpd or even higher are 
now possible with BRT. Guangzhou achieves throughput of 27,400 pphpd, and new systems under construction 
in Rio de Janeiro promise to achieve even higher throughput levels than Bogotá and Guangzhou.

\figure{assets/image26.jpeg}{The use of multiple sub-stops, in this case three in each direction, has 
been one of the principal reasons Bogotá is able to achieve very high customer capacities. Photo}{ Akiris.}

At any given point on TransMilenio’s corridors a vehicle passes every twenty seconds—a headway that 
would lead to significant saturation on a corridor without passing lanes. However, with passing lanes 
and multiple sub-stops and docking bays, the headway at *each* docking bay tends to be around one minute. 
Guangzhou similarly achieves very high frequency, and is, with Bogotá, the highest vehicle frequency 
BRT in the world, averaging around one vehicle every eleven seconds in the peak direction and peak hour. 
The Brisbane Busway achieves peak-hour vehicle frequencies of one vehicle every fourteen seconds in a 
single direction.

The presence of multiple sub-stops serves two distinct purposes. First, the multiple sub-stops permit 
many different types of services to operate from the same station, such as local services or limited-stop 
services. Each sub-stop represents a different set of services or routes. Second, the multiple sub-stops 
can dramatically reduce the saturation level at the stations. Since station saturation is typically the 
principal barrier to higher-capacity services, adding sub-stops is perhaps the cornerstone of any proposed 
system requiring higher capacity levels.

As noted earlier, to maintain a high level of service, saturation levels should be 40 percent or below. 
If saturation is over that, a second lane and a second sub-stop are likely to be required. As saturation 
increases, more sub-stops will be needed. In order to maintain a saturation factor of less than 0.40, 
services at each sub-stop must be properly scheduled and spaced to limit congestion. A saturation factor 
of 0.40 corresponds to approximately 60 vehicles per hour, but the specific sub-stop demand can reduce 
or increase this value. If 18-meter articulated vehicles are utilized, then 60 vehicles per hour corresponds 
to an approximate capacity of 9,000 pphpd, and this figure is a general limit for a simple one-lane operation. 
Since a lane will begin to congest once seventy vehicles per hour per direction is reached, a second 
sub-stop is recommended whenever volumes exceed this level. 

*Inclusion of Limited-Stop Services*

\figure{assets/image27.jpeg}{Shidajida BRT station in Guangzhou, at the midpoint underneath the access 
bridge, has one lane carrying 27,000 people and one vehicle every 10 seconds in a single direction during 
the peak hour. This system has the world’s highest BRT vehicle carrying frequency. Image}{ ITDP.}


With the inclusion of overtaking lanes, to increase capacity further, limited-stop services are likely 
to be the most relevant tool for planners. These services do not add to station saturation. In addition, 
they have higher commercial speeds. This way, stations with the highest demands can have services go 
directly to them. The potential of “express services” is limited for practical purposes, as the higher 
the demand, the easier it is to provide limited-stop services. One lane can serve up to 720 articulated-vehicles 
per hour. If 50 percent of this is used, that would be equivalent to more than 50,000 pphpd. Section 
6.7.2 discusses how to implement direct service patterns. In the case of TransMilenio, approximately 
50 percent of vehicles serve these types of routes. 

*Passing Lanes at Stations Only*

The principal difficulty in including a passing lane is the impact on road space. Unless the corridor 
is highly saturated, passing lanes are usually not required beyond the stations. However, at station 
locations, the BRT system will occupy the width of the station plus two lanes in either direction, an 
approximate total of five lane widths for a station that serves both directions or a total of three lanes 
if the sub-stops for each direction are offset from each other. As discussed in Chapter 24: Intersections 
and Signal Control, if the BRT is in a section with intersections, narrowing mixed-traffic lanes will 
have no impact on the segment capacity if the station is at an appropriate distance from the intersections.

\figure{assets/image28.jpeg}{In order to accommodate passing lanes at stations on the proposed Dar es Salaam system, the 
road infrastructure was widened.} {ITDP.}

Other options for accommodating passing lanes in express roadways include making property purchases 
for widening. In some BRT cities, such as Barranquilla, Colombia, plans called for the purchase of properties 
near station areas. The road infrastructure was widened in these areas in order to accommodate the passing 
lane. This same strategy has been employed at some stations in the BRT system in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 
as shown in Figure 7.17. The viability of property purchases for this purpose depends on local property 
costs, as well as the existence of a well-designed compensation program for property owners. 


\subsection{Convoying}

In general, multiple sub-stops are coupled with passing lanes in order to allow vehicles to pass one 
another and thus readily access the appropriate docking bay. However, if there is insufficient space 
for passing lanes, there is still a way to utilize multiple sub-stops without a passing lane. Some of 
the benefits of separate sub-stops can be achieved through the “convoying” or “platooning” of vehicles. 
Convoys involve two or more vehicles operating along the busway in a closely bunched pack. In some respects, 
a convoy system is similar to an extended set of rail cars. The order of the vehicles is typically set 
so that the first vehicle stops at the far sub-stop, and the next vehicle stops at the subsequent one. 


A single lane operating with a single sub-stop per station can achieve a corridor capacity of approximately 
9,000 pphpd. Convoys can increase capacity by around 50 percent to a maximum of 13,000 pphpd without 
any reduction in the level of service. 

Unfortunately, the convoying or platooning of vehicles is difficult to manage and control. The vehicles 
must enter the busway in the right order or there will be delays and backing up of vehicles. Further, 
since customer boardings will vary for different vehicles, the dwell times will also vary. Some vehicles 
may needlessly wait behind others that have a longer boarding process. Thus, in a convoy system the slowest 
vehicle will likely set the speed for the entire fleet. For these reasons, multiple sub-stops are best 
implemented through the provision of passing lanes at stations. 

Some conventional systems utilizing convoying have achieved corridor capacities over 20,000 pphpd. 
Both the Farrapos and the Assis Brasil bus corridors in Porto Alegre, Brazil, reach peak capacities of 
over 20,000 pphpd through convoying techniques. Nevertheless, the penalty for extending convoying to 
this level without reducing boarding and alighting times is a reduced level of service in terms of average 
speed.

\figure{assets/image29.jpeg}{Convoying allows the Porto Alegre system to achieve peak capacities of over 20,000 pphpd, 
but at the same time this technique can result in busway and station congestion, and therefore slow average 
vehicle speeds.}{Lloyd Wright.}

Systems may operate as ordered convoys or non-ordered convoys. In an ordered convoy, the vehicles must 
approach the station in a set order so that the vehicles stop in the designated sub-stop. Signage at 
the station instructs customers which sub-stop corresponds with their intended route. To manage and control 
the order of the vehicles entering the busway, a control center in conjunction with automatic vehicle 
locating (AVL) technology will be essential. Communications between the control center and the drivers 
allow each vehicle to adjust its position in order to enter the busway at the right moment.

In a non-ordered convoy, the vehicles approach the station in any order, depending on the timing of 
each vehicle’s entry into the main busway. In this case, customers will not know at which sub-stop their 
intended route will stop. Even if announcements give customers a brief warning, there is still likely 
to be some confusion. This situation implies that customers may be running from one end of the station 
to the other in search of their intended vehicle, or as mentioned previously, will have to flag down 
the bus to make a second stop at the station in order to pick them up.
