BRT station saturation is discussed in more detail in *Chapter 7: System Speed and Capacity*. The discussion 
of capacity in this section should be considered as a supplement to that chapter. This section introduces 
some specific concepts of capacity related to the configuration of BRT stations, whereas *Chapter 7* 
provides a more detailed and comprehensive coverage of BRT routes and overall operational capacity.

BRT stations can be broadly divided according to capacity by whether or not they have passing lanes 
and sub-stops, and whether the stations have more than one bus docking bay in each direction and sub-stop. 
High capacity systems feature BRT stations with passing lanes and multiple sub-stops. Medium capacity 
systems do not have passing lanes, but have multiple docking bays. Low capacity BRT systems have stations 
with no passing lanes and only one docking bay in each direction.

Considerable fluidity exists in each of the categories below, especially in cases where features such 
as passing lanes, sub-stops, and multiple docking bays are provided but do not actually function properly 
due to design shortcomings. 

Using the criteria mentioned above and explained further later in this chapter, Table 25.1 categorizes 
BRT systems as either high, medium or low capacity. The categories in Table 25.1 are based on BRT station 
design capacity rather than the actual operating capacity. (BRT system capacity is also influenced by 
factors other than BRT stations, including the operational and intersection design, as discussed in *Chapter 
7*.) Table 25.1 also lists the actual operating capacity measured in field surveys by ITDP. In general, 
the higher-capacity stations correspond to the higher throughput systems, though there are exceptions. 
From Table 25.1 it can be seen that the Los Angeles Silver Line has a high design capacity but a very 
low throughput, meaning the corridor can handle more demand easily and that could be obtained through 
densification around the corridor or using direct services to bring more people to the system. Conversely 
systems with a low- or medium- design capacity but relatively high throughput – such as Istanbul, Xiamen, 
Mexico City, Zhengzhou, Urumqi, Chengdu, and Quito – are likely to suffer from overcrowding, delays and 
bus queuing at some stations during peak hours. More critically, especially in cities which are still 
growing, these systems are likely to be already operating at or above capacity limits and hence have 
little capacity to take on extra ridership or growth.

The fact that a station is classified as ‘high’ capacity in Table 25-1 does not mean that stations 
do not suffer from overcrowding. Some of Bogotá’s BRT stations suffer from severe overcrowding despite 
the fact that stations have a high-capacity design. A major problem in this regard is that most station 
sub-stops in Bogotá have only one bus docking bay that serves several routes. This results in crowding 
passengers for one route obstructing alighting passengers as well as passengers waiting to board a different 
route at the same sub-stop. Table 25.1 includes a listing of the high-capacity stations which have only 
one docking bay at each sub-stop: Bogotá, Lima, Peru, and Cali, Colombia. Cape Town, South Africa, despite 
having passing lanes, has BRT stations predominantly with neither multiple sub-stops nor multiple docking 
bays. For this reason despite having passing lanes, the design capacity is classified as low. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image12.jpeg}{Crowding in a Bogotá station impedes peak hour circulation and is exacerbated 
by the presence of just one docking bay at each sub-stop, in many stations.}{Karl Fjellstrom}

With regard to Table 25.1, the design capacity of the station is only one factor in the system performance 
and overall capacity. Other key factors include the use of larger buses, express services, the number 
and width of doors in the buses, off-board fare collection, the level of crowding in stations and buses 
(extreme crowding can lead to extra delays in boarding and alighting), operational configuration (including 
the number of transfers), intersection design along the BRT corridor, and the stopping distance between 
the bus and the platform. Closer distances between the bus and the platform may take longer for drivers 
to execute, having the effect of reducing speed and capacity, but will enable passengers to board and 
alight more quickly, which has the effect of increasing speed and capacity.

\* Note that this is an overall estimate of capacity. In some cases cities have a combination of “low” 
(with only one docking bay per direction) and “medium” (with two docking bays per direction) stations.Source: 
data from www.worldbrt.net, accessed 8 October 2014. Throughput counts are all based on actual ITDP field 
counts. Actual system capacity is determined not only by stations, but by a range of operational factors 
described in the chapter on BRT capacity and speed.

\subsection{Station Sub-stops}

A sub-stop is a station subdivision or module. When equipped with passing lanes, one BRT station can 
be divided into multiple sub-stops. In order to function, sub-stops require passing lanes or a functional 
equivalent such as in the directional BRT stations used in Lanzhou and Yichang, China. Calculation of 
the capacity of station sub-stops is covered in more detail in *Chapter* 7.

Figure xxxx shows an example of Dongpu BRT station in Guangzhou, China, which has three sub-stops in 
each direction. Each sub-stop is forty meters long, with docking bays for two 18-meter buses or three 
12-meter buses. Fare collection space is 15 meters, though in more recent designs ITDP uses a more compressed 
10-meter space for fare collection. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image13.jpeg}{Dongpu BRT station in Guangzhou shows the station divisions 
including the access and arrival areas, the entrance area including the space for fare collection, and 
the three sub-stops, which can be identified by the different roof material and variation in elevation. 
At each sub-stop, multiple docking bays are seen and the station includes passing lanes. Between sub-stops 
is space for buses to pull into or out of the station around other buses already docked.}{Karl 
Fjellstrom}

\figure[medium]{assets/image14.jpeg}{Dongpu BRT station in Guangzhou in plan view shows more clearly 
the parts of the station, which consists of 3 sub-stops in each direction, with a total length of 180m. 
Each sub-stop consists of 2 docking bays for 18m BRT buses, or 3 sub-stops for 12m BRT buses. A = fare 
collection and B = passing area. The platform is 5m wide.}{ITDP China and GMEDRI.}

\subsection{High-capacity Stations}

High-capacity BRT stations are those with functioning passing lanes and multiple sub-stops. There are, 
however, exceptions. Istanbul’s BRT is one of the world’s highest capacity BRT systems, with nearly 20,000 
passengers per hour per direction (pphpd) but without passing lanes or sub-stops. Istanbul, however, 
is a very special case based on an expressway right-of-way with no traffic lights and contra-flow traffic 
operation which ensures zero encroachment of other vehicles, no defined docking bays inside the station, 
and particular demand and road network conditions that are difficult or impossible to duplicate elsewhere.

High-capacity BRT – with the exception of Istanbul’s particular circumstances, which like Brisbane 
does not clearly define bus docking bays – requires passing lanes with sub-stops.

\subsection{Medium-capacity Stations}

Medium-capacity BRT stations are those without passing lanes, but with more than one bus docking bay 
in each direction.

\subsection{Low-capacity Stations}

Low-capacity stations have neither passing lanes nor sub-stops, and have only one docking bay for BRT 
vehicles.

\subsection{Modularity and Scalability}

In situations where expansion may be necessary within ten to twenty years, BRT stations should be designed 
accordingly. Modular BRT stations can be expanded through the addition of station sub-stops. Bogotá’s 
TransMilenio provides an excellent example where space was provided for expansion, as was done at the 
Calle 100 station. The station had two sub-stops in 2005, but another was added as demand increased, 
so that by 2013, the station had three sub-stops. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image35.jpg}{The image on the left is the Calle 100 station in 2005 with 
just two sub-stops, but space for more. The image on the right is the same station in 2013 with an additional 
sub-stopn having been added due to increased demand.}{ Google Earth}

Cali has also added station modules at some crowded stations. The Chiminangos BRT station originally 
has only one sub-stop, but again space for expansion was left, so that another sub-stop could be added, 
as it was, when demand required it. Although it would have been preferable to build a larger station 
from the beginning, the modular approach to station design makes it possible to fairly easily add station 
modules at particular overcrowded stations. It is much more difficult, or usually impossible, to achieve 
the same expansion in stations which have not been designed with a modular approach to sub-stops. But 
space must also be reserved for expansion in the roadway.

Modularity also may help with fabrication and construction costs and impacts. By fabricating most of 
the station off-site, it hopefully can reduce the construction impacts of the corridor, as the station 
can have the foundation laid directly in the corridor and then then station can be placed on that.
