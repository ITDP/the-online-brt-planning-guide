This section covers the location of a station along a BRT corridor.  BRT stations are generally spaced 
300 meters to 800 meters apart.  In an urban area, spacing optimizes at around 450 meters.  Beyond this, 
more time is imposed on customers walking to stations than is saved from higher bus speeds.  Below this 
distance, bus speeds will be reduced by more than the time saved with shorter walking distances.  See 
*Chapter 6: Service Planning* for more details.

Outside of overall system requirements, the exact location of a station is highly site-specific.  The 
goal is to make the station as easy to access as possible and as close to nearby origins and destinations 
as possible.  No one wants to see a station and not be able to get to it.  Following are general consideration 
for locating stations.

\item Existing bus stops may be prime locations and already ingrained in the public's mental map of 
the area.
\item Locate traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, bridges and tunnels to facilitate direct pedestrian 
access.
\item Where possible, place the station at least 26 meters (85 feet) but ideally 40 meters (130 feet) 
from the intersections to minimize delays to the bus.
\item Where the bus operates in mixed traffic, locate stations to ensure that the bus maintains its 
place in the traffic queue, can depart when ready, and does not have to re-merge into traffic.
\item Map nearby origins and destinations, walking and cycling network, then adjust the station location 
to facilitate direct pedestrian access.
\item Integrate stations into nearby buildings, plazas and commercial streets.
\item Modular station units can be arranged to fit various sites.
\item Stations may be separated by direction or serve both direction depending on space available and 
operation requirements.  Transfer stations should serve both directions simultaneously.
\item At signalized intersections, stations should be *near-side* so that boarding and alighting time 
can overlap with the traffic signal red phase.  Provide traffic signal priority for the BRT.
\item At unsignalized locations, stations should be *far-side* (in the direction of travel) so that 
passengers exit and cross behind the bus.
\item Where blocks lengths are short, the station can be placed mid-block and accessed from both ends.
\item Allow for additional platforms within a 20 year horizon.  It is better to plan for and reserve 
the space before additional development occurs.
\item Avoid placing stations simply where land is available.  In the long run, these locations may not 
be optimal and will just frustrate passengers.  Stations should not be located in the places of least 
resistance, but close to the places where people want to go.

One of the most common mistakes made during BRT planning is to place stations too far apart. As a rule 
of thumb, BRT stations should be spaced around 450 meters apart in urban areas; or 600m-700m for stations 
with multiple sub-stops. Outside built-up areas stations may be further apart, though should rarely be 
more than 800 meters apart. Yichangâ€™s BRT in the map below shows one particularly long gap between stations, 
of 1.7 kilometers between Pinghu and Sanxia Chacheng, due to a cliff alongside a riverfront that has 
no passenger demand or space for a station, yet still achieves an average station spacing of less than 
650m. In the lower capacity system designed by ITDP in Vientiane, stations are smaller and this is reflected 
in an average station spacing of 500m (Figure 25.49).

The best guide to BRT station location is the location of existing bus stops. Usually, though, especially 
where high capacity BRT stations are being implemented, placement is heavily constrained by local physical 
conditions of the corridor including the locations of intersections. 

Figure 25.51 top locations were used to guide the BRT station locations in Lanzhou 
and Yichang. In the case of Lanzhou, the BRT stations largely corresponded with the current bus stop 
locations, though with selected variations. In Yichang, station planning also took into account existing 
bus stops for most of the corridor, but for the central area the BRT station coverage is much denser 
than the bus stops. This is due to the fact that the central area bus stop coverage in Yichang prior 
to the BRT system implementation was inadequate, with stations spaced too far apart.
