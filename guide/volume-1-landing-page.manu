Volume I lays the groundwork for initiating a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system from the initiation of a project to sparking real momentum that will bring the project into reality. BRT systems have become increasingly popular as a cost effective way for cities around the world to provide high quality transit. However, it is crucial to the success of a project's development that a driven and committed group of people advocate for BRT (Chapter 1), explain how the system works and the reasons why it is needed (Chapter 2), and capture the necessary political commitment and leadership to catalyze a fully comprehensive setup and planning process (Chapter 3). 

Project teams will need to look at a number of factors that are described in detail in Volume I, as these will determine the BRT system potential for success. These include: capital and operating costs, performance, flexibility, scalability, implementation speed, and the impact the system will have socially and environmentally on the immediate surroundings of the system as well as the metropolitan region as a whole. The first three chapters of the BRT Planning Guide delve into these factors among others while providing examples of how advocates, governments, and citizens alike have provided the vision, leadership, and action to see the project through and launch a successful BRT system.
