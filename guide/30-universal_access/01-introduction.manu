\section{Introduction}

Most customers benefit from inclusive features on and around BRT systems. For example, everyone benefits
from good sidewalks leading to BRT stations, a narrow platform-to-vehicle gap, nonskid floors, plentiful
handholds on BRT vehicles, audio and text signage in stations and on vehicles, and drivers trained to
avoid sudden starts and stops. However, for customers with special needs, inclusive design often makes
the difference between being able to use the system or not. Such customers include:

\item Customers with permanent or temporary physical disabilities, including those who use canes, crutches,
or wheelchairs, and those with hidden disabilities such as arthritis or a heart condition. Most frail
elderly persons will fit into this category;

\item Customers with sensory disabilities, such as blind persons, those with reduced vision, and persons
who are deaf or hard-of-hearing;

\item Customers with temporary or permanent cognitive challenges, such as first-time BRT users, people
who do not speak the language, the illiterate, and tourists;

\item Children and young customers, who may need more orientation than other customers, or benefit from
design features for short persons;

\item Customers with children, or pregnant women;

\item Customers travelling with packages and luggage.

The number of people who benefit from universal design is growing. According to United Nations data,
existing BRT systems must incorporate an average of over 40 percent more older persons into their service
areas during the next twenty years.

\subsection{Not Just Wheelchairs}

Because wheelchair users are especially identifiable, they have become surrogates for other categories
of beneficiaries of universal design. This contributes to the general practice of saying a vehicle “is
accessible” or “is not accessible” solely based on the ability of customers using wheelchairs to get
on the vehicle. Yet, for every wheelchair user, there are up to four persons using canes, crutches, or
other mobility aids, and the percentage of persons with disabilities with sensory and cognitive disabilities
is greater than the percentage with mobility impairments.

\subsection{ Where are the Special Needs Customers?}

Trips by the disabled tend to parallel travel patterns of all other customers. The assumption that
they are concentrated in select areas is seldom correct in regions with accessible public transport systems
and a culture of independent living. The maps below illustrate the experience of San Francisco, California,
USA.

\subsection{Can Public Transport Accommodate the Disabled?}

Public transport systems, including BRT, can and do play a role in accommodating the disabled.

\item Curitiba provides 21,000 daily trips for registered disabled persons (slightly under 1 percent
of all trips). Of this number, about 1,000 individual wheelchair users ride the system daily, implying
in excess of 500,000 one-way trips per year, forming part of 8 million annual trips by all registered
disabled persons and their attendants. This number does not include unregistered users.
\item San Francisco, California, provides 180,000 to 200,000 trips by wheelchair users per year system-wide,
or approximately 200 trips per year per vehicle in peak hour service.

Crafting a BRT system accessible to all, from those with hidden disabilities to those in wheelchairs,
benefits everyone and remains the goal of a just and equitable society.

\subsection{Islands of Accessibility}

A full-featured BRT corridor may begin its life as an island of accessibility in a sea of inaccessibility.
Streets with no sidewalks, sidewalks with no ramps, sidewalks in disrepair, noncontiguous sidewalks,
vehicles parked in the road and on the sidewalk, sidewalks jammed with vendors, shops, and garbage, and
drivers who do not yield to pedestrians all limit access to public transport. Accessible BRT counters
this. It can stimulate a growing network of accessible streets and sidewalks reaching far beyond the
actual BRT.
