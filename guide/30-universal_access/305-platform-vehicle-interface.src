\section{ Platform-Vehicle Interface}

> So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that life’s a great balancing act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left.
@ Dr. Seuss, writer and cartoonist, 1904–1991

The platform-vehicle interface can significantly affect accessibility for a variety of users. Levelness 
and gap issues can be serious barriers to access. This section describes techniques to ensure that the 
interface between the station platform and vehicle is accessible for all users.

There are many means to alleviating platform-vehicle interface issues. In Chapter 25: Stations, a variety 
of mechanisms that can be applied are evaluated and explained. Those mechanisms include:
\item Level Boarding;
\item Platform-Vehicle Gap;
\item Boarding Bridges;
