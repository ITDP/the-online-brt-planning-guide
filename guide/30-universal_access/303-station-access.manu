\' TODO: add ref '\Chapter 29: Pedestrian Integration covers pedestrian access to stations and terminals. This chapter 
highlights specific accessibility issues. 

The image below summarizes some of the main features detailed in this and the following section.

\number Traffic lights with acoustic signals; 
\number Access ramps; 
\number Well-marked pedestrian crossings;
\number Curb ramps with color and texture differentiation;
\number Accessible pedestrian walkways;
\number Wide fare gates.

\subsection{Walkways}

\figure{assets/image10.jpeg}{Constructing a BRT system provides the opportunity to address accessibility 
issues on routes to stations (Boston).}{Michael King.}

Walkways refer to any facility used by pedestrians, including sidewalks, pavements, shared streets, 
footpaths, and paths. As a general rule, accessible and well-lit walkways should exist along the main 
approaches to all BRT stations. They should extend for at least 400 meters in all directions. Ideally, 
they should exist along the entire length of any BRT trunk line. The following are critical accessibility 
elements and dimensions for walkways:

\item Straight and unobstructed;
\item Smooth, even, well-paved, nonskid surfaces; 
\item Contrasting color for street furniture and other obstacles; 
\item Minimum passing width for a wheelchair at an obstruction—0.9 meters;
\item Minimum overhead clearance (at signs)—2.0 meters;
\item Maximum cross-slope (for drainage)—2 percent;
\item No gratings or other items that would catch the small front wheels of wheelchairs; 
\item Maximum opening or gap in a grating—13 millimeters.

\subsection{Tactile Guideways}

Michael King.}

Tactile guideways are characterized by a series of raised parallel bars pointing in the direction of 
travel. The bars are typically molded into a 300-millimeter-square tile, installed one or two tiles wide. 
They benefit blind persons and those with reduced vision and help others to find their way: 

\item Across large unmarked areas;
\item Along complex paths to a specific destination (information booth, BRT station);
\item On walkways without a well-defined boundary with the road.

Guideways should be used in a consistent manner within a country and should be in a color contrasting 
with their surroundings. Research has shown that grooved concrete is not detectable underfoot. Therefore, 
texture differences should be detectable under foot and by a long cane.

In BRT environments, a tactile guideway is useful to mark a travel path from a sidewalk to a pedestrian 
crossing to a BRT station. It can continue on the other side of the crossing, turning up the ramp into 
the station and proceeding to the ticket vending and information booth. The guideway can then proceed 
down the center line of the station, with guideways branching off at right angles to station doors. 

\subsection{Tactile Warnings}

\figure{assets/image13.jpeg}{Warning strips mark platform edges of BRT and rail stations.}{Tom 
Rickert/AEI.}

Tactile warnings, also called attention patterns and detectable warning strips, are characterized by 
a series of raised truncated domes, typically molded into a 300-millimeter-square tile. They mark *edge* 
or *stop* locations, such as platform edges or curb ramps. They are typically two tiles wide to assure 
that pedestrians do not step over them. They are of a contrasting color with the surrounding surface. 
In some countries, tactile warnings are placed immediately adjacent to the edge or curb, while in other 
countries they are placed 600 to 1,000 millimeters away. Tiles are recommended as they can be detected 
by canes as well as underfoot. Maintenance is key so that broken tiles do not become trip hazards (Bentzen 
and Barlow 2011).

\subsection{Curb Ramps}

\figure{assets/image16.jpeg}{Curb ramps are required on both sides of the street, and at any median 
in between. The median opposite the curb ramp shown here in Mexico City lacks a curb ramp.}{Michael 
King.}

Curb ramps (also known as pedestrian ramps, wheelchair ramps, and curb cuts) are ramps that allow a 
person in a wheelchair to roll up or down at a curb, instead of stepping. They benefit people with walkers, 
strollers, bicycles, carts, and anyone else who has trouble with steps. The slope of a curb ramp is critical, 
lest a person in a wheelchair fall backward. Also critical is placing a curb ramp at the opposite side 
of the street. 

General curb ramp requirements, based on TRL guidelines:

\item Placement: within crosswalk markings;
\item Orientation: perpendicular to curb (creates a flush public transportation);
\item Width: ideally equal to crosswalk width, minimum 1.2 meters;
\item Slope: maximum 1:12 (8 percent);
\item Side flange slope: 1:10 (9 percent);
\item Level landing and turning area: 1.5-meter square at top and bottom of ramp;
\item Tactile warning strip at base of the ramp.

Curb ramps should be required in all new construction, and there should be a program to retrofit existing 
streets. As a priority, curb ramps should be installed on routes between BRT stations and important trip 
generators. 

\subsection{Raised Crossings}

\figure[medium]{assets/image17.jpeg}{Raised crosswalk at bus stop in Mérida, Mexico.}{Michael King.}

An alternative to curb ramps is a raised crosswalk (raised crossing, raised intersection, continuous 
sidewalk). Here the street is raised to sidewalk level, and pedestrians cross without having to step 
down to street level. It is recommended for all streets with speeds of 50 kilometers per hour or less 
and may be used elsewhere.

\subsection{Traffic Signals}

\figure[medium]{assets/image20.png}{A “walking man” countdown signal in Mexico City. The green man speeds up 
as the clock ticks to zero.}{Michael King.}

Where traffic signals are employed, they must be timed so that slower pedestrians have sufficient time 
to cross the street (0.75 meters per second). Countdown, tactile, and audible indicators are preferred.

\subsection{Pedestrian Bridges and Tunnels}

As discussed in \'TODO: add ref '\Chapter 29: Pedestrian Access, at-grade crossings are preferred to access BRT stations. 
Should a pedestrian bridge or tunnel be considered, a tunnel with ramps is preferred. The second choice 
would be a bridge with ramps. Elevators are a last choice for reasons other than accessibility. 

Tunnels are preferred because they require less vertical clearance (than a bridge over a roadway), 
thus the ramp slope and/or distance is less. While bridges with ramps may be technically “accessible” 
to a wheelchair user, the sheer length of ramps to pedestrian bridges is so daunting that most wheelchair 
users are unlikely to use the ramp without the help of a friend to push the chair. Customers with less 
visible disabilities, such as arthritis or a heart condition, may also find long ramps difficult to access. 
Elevator procurement is costly, and elevator maintenance can become an issue for the operator. For this 
reason, Bogotá’s TransMilenio will avoid elevators in the future.

\subsection{“Special” Crossings }

China. There are many who would benefit from elevators and shallow ramps who instead are deterred by 
the approach.}{Michael King.}

Persons with disabilities should cross the street and access BRT stations along with everyone else. 
“Special” crossing and access points are to be discouraged. This practice relies on the presence of security 
or traffic personnel, which may or may not be available, and it has been viewed as preventing access 
by persons with mobility impairments in Latin American and Asian countries. 

\subsection{Ramps to BRT Stations}

Ramps are the preferred method of access to BRT stations, as opposed to elevators or stairs. Station 
assistants may be assigned to assist wheelchair users and others who need help up the ramp. 

General ramp criteria (TRL 2004, pp. 145–146):

\item Width: equal to station width;
\item Slope—1:20 (5 percent), maximum 1:12 (8 percent);
\item Run (length)—maximum 9 meters with no resting area;
\item Rise (height)—maximum 0.75 meters with no resting area;
\item Level resting area dimensions—equal to width of ramp by 1.5 meters;
\item Handrails on both sides;
\item Level landing and turning area—1.5 meters square at top and bottom of ramp.

The norms in some countries specify a level resting area after a maximum run of 6 meters (e.g., Argentina’s 
Ley Nacional 24314), others specify 9 meters, and others specify other lengths. Section 4.8 of the United 
States’ ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) states, “The shortest possible grade for a ramp shall be 
used. The maximum angle for a ramp in new construction should be 1:12. The maximum rise should be 30 
inches (760 mm)” before a horizontal resting area.
