\section{Vehicles}

> The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk.
@ Marcus Tullius Cicero, philosopher and politician, 107 BC–43 BC

This section discusses accessibility features of BRT trunk-line vehicles and feeder buses. 

Feeder bus lines that are carefully integrated into larger BRT trunk lines are more likely to be operated 
in an accessible manner. Sometimes called “complementary buses,” they are found in several cities, such 
as Cali, Colombia, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Typically, a single vehicle design is chosen that 
can exhibit accessibility features such as audio and visual on-board signage and, to different degrees, 
access for those who cannot climb steps. They have high doors on one side for use at trunk-line stations 
and low doors with steps, supplemented by ramps or lifts, for use at curbside stops, where the buses 
operate in mixed traffic. 

A different challenge presents itself if feeder bus lines are cannot climb steps. They have high doors 
on one side for use at trunk more difficult for such a system to consistently exhibit the driver training, 
audio and visual signage, minimal vehicle-to-curb and vehicle-to-platform distances, and so forth.

\figure[medium]{assets/image53.jpeg}{The presence of stairs between vehicle floor levels can limit the maneuvering 
room to get into a securement position.}{Eduardo Alvarez.}

From an internal accessibility standpoint, a standard layout is preferred: one level floor, straight 
aisle, simple seating plan, seats of a uniform height. This regularity makes the vehicle more accessible 
for customers in wheelchairs and with disabilities. High-floor vehicles, because the wheels lie beneath 
the seats, generally use this standard layout. 

Low-floor vehicles, while easier to board from the street, generally have an interior design that is 
less accessible. There are usually multiple levels with steps or ramps between; the aisles tend not to 
be straight; the seats are at irregular heights; and a person in a wheelchair is typically constrained 
to a single location. This irregularity degrades accessibility, especially when the vehicle is crowded.

While any vehicle can be made minimally accessible, the goal should be to ease use for all. Similarly, 
vehicles with unusual seating plans may create interest, but if the design detracts and dissuades use, 
then it loses credibility.

Recent advances in low-floor vehicle design in western and northern Europe may improve accessibility, 
as vehicle wheel wells and engines have been modified to create less intrusion into the passenger cabin. 
Several cities in France, including Rouen, Lille, and Paris, now have low-floor BRT systems that appear 
to perform well for customers with disabilities. A special case is Nantes, France, which is using higher-capacity 
low-floor articulated vehicles that permit boarding through four doors, thus enhancing customer flows.

\subsection{Internal Elements}

\subsubsection{Hand Grasps}

\figure{assets/image55.png}{Vertical stanchions and grab bars are provided on TransMilenio to assist 
customers; however, better color contrast is needed.}{TransMilenio.}

Accessible BRT vehicles have vertical stanchions and horizontal grab bars within reach of all customers. 
They should be placed so that a person may navigate from one stanchion to another over the length of 
the vehicle. Ideally this is one per seat, or every 1,050 millimeters, whichever is less. The distance 
between stanchions should not exceed 1,200 millimeters. Stanchions and handholds should be painted in 
a contrasting color, typically a bright yellow. Straps hanging from horizontal elements near the ceiling 
can provide handholds to help customers reach a seat, while vertical stanchions also help shorter persons 
who cannot reach other handholds.

\subsubsection{Seat Design}

It is important for persons with disabilities that seats are surfaced with materials with a coefficient 
of friction sufficient to prevent customers from sliding back and forth while the vehicle is in motion. 
Seat surfaces should be ergonomically contoured. Ideal dimensions are noted in DPTAC and COST 349 (MacDonald 
2005, pp. 17–18). 

\subsubsection{Prioritized Seats}

\figure{assets/image56.jpeg}{The blue seats on this TransMilenio vehicle are reserved for pregnant 
women and customers with disabilities in Bogotá’s BRT system}{Lloyd Wright}

\figure[medium]{assets/image57.jpeg}{Dedicated seats (in blue) are interspersed with other customer seats }{Tom Rickert/AEI}

Prioritized seats should be available for persons with disabilities, seniors, and pregnant women. These 
seats should face the front or rear of the vehicle, not toward the side, to provide more stability when 
the vehicle starts, stops, and turns. Priority seats require clear signage, adequate space, and should 
be located near the driver. The area around the seat should provide room to store a mobility aid, such 
as a folded wheelchair, a walker, crutches, or a “seeing eye” dog guide. 

Contrasting colors help identify priority seats. The color should be consistent across the system and 
should be determined by local preference or mandate. 

\subsubsection{Wheelchair Travel Path}

\figure{assets/image58.jpeg}{Wheelchair securement opposite entrance. }{TransMilenio.}

Ideally, securement areas are located opposite doorways to minimize travel within the vehicle. Where 
there is only one per vehicle, it should be located near the driver. When not in use, it may be occupied 
by standing customers, folding seats, bicycles, prams, carriages, and so forth. 

Standard dimensions (MacDonald 2005):

\item Doorway: 850 millimeters wide; 
\item Clear route from door to securement location: 750 millimeters;
\item Turning area: 1500-millimeter circle;
\item Securement area: 750 millimeters wide and 1300 millimeters long;
\item Unoccupied wheelchair: 700 millimeters x 1200 millimeters.

It is recommended that vehicle vendors be made responsible for wheelchair accommodation. Typically, 
this is via detailed design drawings illustrating minimum dimensions and travel paths. Ideally, wheelchair 
users would test a full-size mock-up (including seats, stanchions, fare box, securement areas, doorways, 
etc.). Wheelchair users vary in their ability to maneuver; a mock-up is useful in understanding how they 
react to a particular design.

\subsubsection{Wheelchair Securement}

Some type of securement system is required. In North America, this is accomplished via a three-point 
safety belt. The customer is seated facing forward or backward. Typically, a wheel clamp is provided. 
Additional methods may be needed when the route includes severe inclines. Not only do “tie-downs” secure 
wheelchair customers, but they also protect others from wayward wheelchairs. In every case, all governing 
norms and standards for safety should be followed. 

On BRT routes with large vehicles, few hills, and minimal curves, the “tie-down-less” system used in 
Europe may be preferred (Figure 30.55). It requires that wheelchair riders face the rear of the vehicle, 
and assumes that drivers are well trained and monitored to avoid sudden stops and starts. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image59.png}{Diagram illustrating Swedish securement system. In order to go between 
the handles of a wheelchair, the backrest is only 300 to 320 millimeters wide and is 480 millimeters 
high to leave space for power chair motors. Behind the backrest, 300 millimeters of clear space is provided 
to allow the customer to maneuver the wheelchair so that his/her back actually rests against the backrest 
(not shown). For more information see COST 349: The Accessibility of Coaches and Long Distance Buses 
for People with Reduced Mobility (MacDonald 2005). }{CGB Mitchell.}

\subsubsection{Turnstiles}

\figure{assets/image60.jpeg}{This turnstile slows down boarding for all customers.}{World Bank.}

Turnstiles in buses are a barrier to many seniors, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, parents 
with children, and persons with packages. They should be eliminated.

\subsubsection{Stop-Request Signals}

Stop-request signals (buttons or cords) are needed on all vehicles that stop on demand (not on the 
fixed BRT corridor). They especially help customers with sensory disabilities. 

Stop cords or buttons should be located near seats. Buttons are generally preferred because they are 
more easily used by persons with less strength in their hands. A lower cord or button is required within 
reach of a customer in a wheelchair securement position. The button or cord should activate a sign in 
front of the vehicle, providing feedback to customers that their request has been received. 

\subsection{Signage}

\subsubsection{Exterior}

All customers benefit from large-print vehicle route and destination signs:
\item On the upper front of the vehicle;
\item High on the side near the entrance door;
\item At the rear.

Signs should be clearly visible with contrasting backgrounds (white or yellow letters against a black 
background). Increasingly, GPS technology permits automatic stop announcements thereby allowing waiting 
customers to hear route information as the vehicle approaches a stop or station.

\endtable

\subsubsection{Interior}

\item Tactile route maps with Braille text should be available for blind customers from the public transport 
operator;
\item Electronic visual displays and audible announcements of the next stop are helpful, including audible 
warnings when doors open or close at trunk line stations. Signs in raised letters assist blind persons 
to identify priority seating for customers with disabilities;
\item Taking advantage of advances in smartphones and other electronic location systems will make the 
BRT more accessible.

\subsection{Vehicle Access}

\subsubsection{First Step and Handrails}

\figure{assets/image61.jpeg}{A low first step makes boarding easier. The man is stepping into the vehicle 
without lifting his body or bending his knee. Once within the stairwell, he is then better able to use 
his upper body strength to mount the remaining stairs.}{TRL Ltd.}

\figure{assets/image62.png}{An ideal combination of raised vehicle stop, low first step, and proper 
vehicle alignment. (Each mark on the rulers equals 50 millimeters.)}{Tom Rickert/AEI.}

There is no combination of features that increases accessibility more than:
\item Reducing both the vertical and horizontal distance between the station and the first step on the 
vehicle;
\item Providing handrails parallel to the steps on *both* sides of the entrance and exit doors. 

Research suggests that the combined horizontal and vertical distance to the first step of a vehicle 
should preferably not exceed 200 millimeters and definitely not exceed 300 millimeters (Department for 
Transport 2004). Handrails mitigate the problem of a high first step, even on older vehicles, by enabling 
frail or semi-ambulatory customers to better use their upper body strength. 

\figure[medium]{assets/image63.png}{The handrail shown is for the center of a two-stream entrance. Handrails 
at the sides of entrances should have the sloping rail and the vertical rail near the outside of the 
vehicle. The vertical rail should extend to within 200 millimeters of the first step. Handrail centerlines 
should be 50 millimeters from bulkheads or doors. On a low-floor vehicle, there should be a vertical 
rail near the outside of the vehicle, plus a horizontal rail 800 to 900 millimeters above floor level. }{DPTAC.}

\subsubsection{Kneeler and Flip-Out Step}

\figure{assets/image64.jpeg}{In Nagoya, Japan, a feeder vehicle, equipped with a flip-out lower step.}{Lloyd Wright.}

Techniques to decrease the distance of the first step include “kneelers” and flip-out steps. A kneeler 
feature lowers the vehicle height of the vehicle by approximately 10 centimeters. A flip-out step effectively 
adds another step to the vehicle stairwell. Both facilitate more rapid boarding by all customers by lessening 
the height of the first step. They are especially useful when the vehicle cannot pull all the way to 
the curb, and customers must board from the street. They do *not* make the vehicle accessible to people 
in wheelchairs.

\subsubsection{On-board Ramps and Lifts}

\figure{assets/image65.jpeg}{A manually operated ramp extended from the vehicle provides access for 
wheelchair users.}{City of Seoul.}

\figure{assets/image66.jpeg}{A special lift allows access for a wheelchair patron to a high-floor feeder 
vehicle in Bogotá.}{TransMilenio SA.}

Ramps and lifts make a vehicle fully accessible to wheelchair users and others who require a level-change 
device. There are two typical types: flip-out and telescoping. Both require fairly consistent distances 
between the vehicle and stop or station. While they may have a reputation of slowing boarding and alighting, 
adhering to the following mitigates this. 

\item Locate at or under the front entrance of the vehicle, under direct supervision of the vehicle 
driver, without requiring the driver to leave his/her seat;
\item Locate near the securement area;
\item Designate boarding locations at the station or stop;
\item Utilize safety features, such as hand grasps and edges or railings, to prevent wheelchairs from 
sliding off ramps or to keep them safely positioned on lifts while being raised to the vehicle floor, 
or lowered to the station. Such features should meet or exceed local requirements.

\subsubsection{Stations}

\figure{assets/image670.png}{Universal design features of bus stops.}
{Adapted by TRL from Oxley, 2002.}

Access by most seniors and customers with disabilities to complementary and feeder buses (even when 
inclusive design features are not yet phased in) can be greatly enhanced by systematically upgrading 
stations, beginning with those stations that are most used by all customers. Good station design can 
enable customers to more easily board vehicles, even when entrances are poorly designed. Good station 
design also enables the stations to become accessible to wheelchair users when lift- or ramp-equipped 
vehicles begin service.

Shelters and waiting areas benefit all customers, and especially assist seniors and those with disabilities. 
They provide protection from sun, rain, wind, and windblown particles. Illuminated shelters provide additional 
security at night, especially for women. 

Stations can extend across a parking lane to the edge of the traffic lane. These “bus bulbs” or “boarders” 
can extend across a parking lane to the edge of the 2-meter curb extension, for example, allows the vehicle 
driver to get the vehicle close to and parallel to the curb so that the vehicle does not need to overhang 
the sidewalk. This in turn permits the station to be raised still further (e.g., 200 to 250 millimeters) 
to give better access to the first step of the vehicle. 

\beginbox{Key Features} \'TODO: Name box '\

Figure 30.63 below illustrates key features, including a flat hard surface, 
minimum dimensions, a clear 
area for boarding, and a curb height, which reduce the distance to the first 
step of a vehicle if bus 
drivers are trained and monitored to properly station the bus adjacent to the 
stop and steps are taken 
to ensure that other vehicles do not park in the stop. An ischiatic support 
is shown, which substitutes 
for seats in low-cost installations. If adequate space for a shelter is 
lacking, the shelter can be placed 
at the rear of the sidewalk, for example, against the side of a building. 
The use of a beveled curb at 
bus stops may enable drivers to position their vehicles closer to the curb, 
as discussed in Section 30.5.
\endbox

\subsection{Deployment}

BRT systems are often faced with the questions of how to prioritize accessibility—that is, where to 
use accessible vehicles first.

\highlight{Option 1: Deploy a few lift- or ramp-equipped vehicles on many or all lines. }

In theory, a well-managed and reliable vehicle service with strict schedule adherence could serve a 
significant portion of travel demand by wheelchair users. It may also be more equitable, as opposed to 
initially concentrating accessible vehicles on one or two lines. The reality, however, is often less 
than ideal. Because this type of system must maintain a certain operational rigor, there are many opportunities 
for it to be unreliable. At best, this system should be reserved for temporary use.

\highlight{Option 2: Phase in lift- or ramp-equipped vehicles on one line at a time, with all equipment accessible. }

Focus on one line at a time during a transition to a fully accessible fleet. This increases the confidence 
of wheelchair users that they will not be subject to long delays, thus helping to market accessibility 
features. Public transport agencies may then focus on the line’s stops, stations, and surrounding infrastructure 
as well. Ideally, the most heavily travelled lines, or lines serving major trip generators such as universities, 
shopping, and residential centers, would be converted first.
