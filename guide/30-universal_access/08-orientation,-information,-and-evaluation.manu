For information on customer communications, see Chapter 10: Public Participation; this section details
elements specific to accessibility to information.

\subsection{ Orientation}

Opening day on an accessible BRT system may be the first time some customers with special needs have
been on a public transport vehicle. Orientation may be needed for such persons (*Public Transport Access
Training Toolkit*, World Bank, 2009). During the orientation there are a couple of methods to consider
that wheelchair users might use to cross the platform-to-vehicle gap:

\item Some wheelchair users will back over the gap so that the typically larger back wheels cross first,
making it easier for the smaller front wheels to cross.
\item Others may find it convenient to have a station assistant or friend assist by pushing their chair
across the gap while pressing down on the back of the chair to reduce pressure on the smaller front wheels
while they cross the gap.

Blind persons also benefit from the opportunity to familiarize themselves with vehicles and public
transport stations before using them for the first time in revenue service. See the *Public Transport
Access Training Toolkit* (World Bank, 2009) for methods to familiarize the general public, public transport
staff, and persons with disabilities in the use of public transport systems by persons with limited mobility.
Additionally, travel orientation opportunities provide a chance to generate favorable media attention
prior to initiating service.

\subsection{ Information}

Marketing and public information requirements for those with special needs should be available in alternative
formats. Focus groups or advisory committees can advise.

\item Large-print brochures;
\item Timetables and maps in Braille;
\item Tactile maps of routes and stations;
\item Accessible website;
\item Text phones;
\item E-mail and social media;
\item Accessible smartphone apps.

\subsubsection{Telephone Center}

Any large public transport system needs a contact telephone number for complaints and compliments.
Phone numbers should be displayed on vehicles and in stations, as well as included in brochures or other
public information. Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing need to be able to text the public transport
agency. Complaint and compliment data should be directed to the different stakeholders in the system,
including persons with disabilities serving on advisory committees. Such transparency can increase confidence
and improve the working relationship between the public transport operator and agencies representing
customers with special needs.

\subsubsection{Service Center}

A centrally located office may be provided for customer service, accessible to wheelchair users.

\subsubsection{Website, Social Media}

An accessible website should be provided, with large, high-contrast text and software that can be used
by persons with different types of disabilities. Photos and animations that interfere with navigating
the site should be replaced by text explanations (World Wide Web Consortium 2016). Increasingly, public
transport operators are able to communicate service announcements in real time using social media.

\subsubsection{Public Education}

A public education program is often helpful to orient the public to the principles of independent living.
The public needs to learn that disabled persons are usually not accompanied by attendants. The public
also needs to be educated to yield priority seats and wheelchair-securement areas. Public education can
include messages included in the electronic signage in stations and vehicles; TV and radio announcements;
and flyers distributed to customers, supplemented by well-publicized events involving persons with disabilities
and local officials. Sample public service announcements are found in Section 4 of the *Public Transport
Access Training Toolkit*.
