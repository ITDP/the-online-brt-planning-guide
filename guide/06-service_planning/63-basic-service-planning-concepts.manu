\subsection{ BRT Stations and Saturation}

With rail systems, the constraint on capacity tends to be the frequency that the signaling system can 
handle. Rail system designers thus frequently try to add longer and longer trains, but on city streets 
eventually this runs up against block lengths. In BRT systems, by contrast, the constraint on capacity 
is the BRT station. Vehicles can platoon, in which many can follow very closely, one behind the next, 
with very high frequencies. A traffic signal can handle far more vehicles passing through it over the 
course of an hour than a bus stop can process. As a result, for BRT, the station saturation problem is 
the critical issue that needs to be solved to maintain system speeds—not intersections or headways, which 
can be defined as the time between two vehicles offering a service, conveying exactly the same information 
as frequency.

Thus understanding the saturation level of a station is a basic starting point in achieving high capacities 
and high speeds (covered in the next chapter), and if there is a risk of station saturation it also becomes 
a primary concern of service planning (covered in this chapter). Saturation level of a station refers 
to the percentage of time that a vehicle stopping bay is occupied. The term *saturation* is also used 
to characterize a roadway, and in particular, the degree to which traffic has reached the design capacity 
of the road.

When engineers talk about the capacity of a road or a BRT system, they will give a capacity for an 
acceptable level of service, rather than for the maximum number of vehicles or customers that could pass 
through a road or a system. After a certain point, the lane or BRT system becomes congested. With congestion, 
the total flow of vehicles may not change (usually it increases at first and later decreases), but the 
vehicles are going slower and slower.

Saturation, of course, changes as the demand (arrival of vehicles) is not perfectly regular; so when 
we talk about saturation we are assuming a permanent flow subject to the irregularity normally observed 
in a roadway or in a busway. The peak hour is an appropriate measure of saturation for dimensioning a 
system.

Exactly because of this irregularity, a level of saturation of (x=) 0.85 is commonly considered acceptable 
for mixed traffic. Below a saturation level of 0.85, increases in traffic will have only a minimal impact 
on average speeds, and the level of service is acceptable. Once saturation levels exceed 0.85, there 
is a dramatic drop in speeds. 

However, with BRT stations, there is no clear breaking point. The queues and delays at bus stations 
occur at small amounts even at low saturation levels, and these delays simply increase with saturation. 
In the case of a bus station, saturation is defined as the percentage of time that the station is occupied 
by vehicles boarding and alighting customers. 

\figure{assets/image8.jpeg}{Relationship between travel time and saturation levelsi.}{ Steer Davies 
Gleave.}

In general, stations should be planned at less than 40 percent saturation, or else the risk of congestion 
increases significantly. The impact of stopping bay saturation on speed is shown in Figure 6.7. 

Rather than a clear point at which the system collapses, station saturation tends to lead to a gradual 
deterioration of service quality. For this reason, the optimum level of station saturation is not clear. 
Some studies argue that the optimum should be around 0.30, but saturation levels as high as 0.60 can 
be tolerated in specific locations if this condition is not general throughout a BRT corridor. However, 
for saturation levels above 0.60, the system can be deemed unstable, and risk of severe congestion and 
system breakdown is considerable.

A low saturation level, or a high level of service, means that there is a low likelihood of vehicles 
waiting in a queue at a BRT stop. A high saturation level means that there will likely be long queues 
at stopping bays. For saturation levels over one ($$x > 1$$), the station will certainly have queues increasing 
to the point where the system does not move until long after the peak is over. 

\subsection{ Sub-Stops and Docking Bays}

A docking bay is the designated area in a BRT station where a vehicle will stop and align itself to 
the boarding platform. Docking bays are typically aligned quite close together, so close in fact that 
one vehicle does not have the space to pull around and pass another vehicle stopped in front of it at 
another docking bay. 

Sub-stops, by contrast, are the stopping areas where one or more docking bays may be located. A station 
may be composed of more than one sub-stop. The critical thing about a sub-stop is that it be far enough 
away from the next sub-stop that any vehicle pulled up to a docking bay in the sub-stop in front of it 
has enough space to pull around and pass the other vehicle. This requires that one BRT vehicle be able 
to pass another BRT vehicle at the sub-stop, which necessitates a passing lane. Because sub-stops and 
passing lanes are extremely critical to avoiding station saturation and hence reaching higher speeds 
and capacities, and making express and limited stop services viable, they are both given points in *The* 
*BRT Standard*.

In the first BRT systems, each station had only one docking bay and one sub-stop. A key innovation 
of Bogotá’s TransMilenio system was that more capacity and speed could be obtained, if, at each station, 
instead of having just one sub-stop with one docking bay, each station might have two or more sub-stops, 
and each sub-stop might have one or two docking bays. In Figure 6.8 the TransMilenio stop has two sub-stops, 
one with one docking bay and one with two docking bays.

\figure{assets/image9.jpeg}{The use of multiple sub-stops and docking bays with passing lanes in Bogotá 
helps minimize vehicle congestion.}{ Oscar Diaz and Por el País que Queremos (PPQ).}

By adding more sub-stops and docking bays (the sub-stops are far more important than the number of 
docking bays), the saturation level of each sub-stop can be kept to a maximum value of 0.40 until very 
high levels of demand are reached. TransMilenio strives to keep the maximum variation in the saturation 
value at no more than 0.10 between sub-stops at the same station, so the values should not vary from 
a range of 0.35 to 0.45. 

\subsection{ Direct Services}

Direct services, sometimes called “trunk extensions” or “complementary” routes, are new BRT services 
that operate both in mixed traffic and inside dedicated BRT infrastructure on trunk routes. Usually, 
they follow former bus or minibus routes that have been converted into BRT services.

When designing BRT services, the easiest thing to do is to simply convert existing public transport 
routes into identical new BRT routes, and allow whatever portion of the existing route that does not 
overlap with planned BRT infrastructure to simply operate in mixed traffic. One of the main advantages 
of BRT over rail-based modes is that buses, unlike rails, can easily leave the trunk infrastructure and 
operate on any normal road.

If a city has already done a good job designing its bus services, and the routes are well correlated 
to trip origins and destinations, it may be a good idea to leave several or most of them more or less 
where they are. Riders are already familiar with these routes, and a conservative approach to BRT service 
planning will minimize the likelihood of major mistakes or public confusion when the new system opens.  
Because such routes need to operate both in mixed traffic and along specialized BRT trunk infrastructure, 
the buses and the fare collection system need to be able to operate in both environments. Generally, 
this will require the procurement of a fleet compatible with the new BRT infrastructure and mixed traffic 
operation. Developing BRT vehicle technical specifications that allow for both BRT trunk and mixed traffic 
operation (see Figure 6.9) significantly improves the flexibility of the system. If the system has central 
median platforms on the BRT trunk corridor, vehicles will need to have doors on both sides. Direct service 
systems increasingly use low-floor buses to ease boarding and alighting off the trunk corridor. Direct 
service operations with flexible vehicles also make it easier to expand BRT trunk infrastructure onto 
other linked corridors without major disruptions in service or new fleet procurement. Direct services 
within a closed system can employ off-board fare collection at BRT stations, but need to have an on-board 
or proof-of-payment fare collection system when using regular bus stops outside the BRT corridor. With 
proof-of-payment systems, inspectors will be needed, and there is risk of fare evasion.

\figure{assets/image10.jpeg}{Two-sided doorway configuration for a direct-service system where the 
bus operates both in the BRT corridor and outside the corridor in mixed traffic.}{ ITDP.}

Until 2010, the only direct-service BRT reaching Silver or Gold Standard was the Brisbane Busway (Australia). 
Many of the Bronze-rated BRT systems with direct services lacked basic administrative controls over access 
to the trunk BRT infrastructure, with lower quality vehicle infrastructure improvements, and these systems 
frequently encountered station saturation problems. Problems of station saturation are not caused by 
direct services, but rather by a misalignment between the service plan and the infrastructure design 
that could happen regardless of service type. Since 2010, several systems have opened (Guangzhou, China; 
Cali, Colombia; Johannesburg, South Africa) that feature Gold- or Silver-Standard BRT infrastructure 
and direct services. These systems all offer services that operate both on Gold- or Silver-Standard BRT 
trunk infrastructure and continue beyond the trunk into mixed traffic.

\figure{assets/image11.jpeg}{Complementary service in Cali.}{Karl Fjellstrom.}

\figure{assets/image12.jpeg}{Complementary service in Johannesburg.}{Yoga Adiwinarto.}

\figure{assets/image13.jpeg}{Complementary services in Guangzhou.}{Far East BRT.}

Guangzhou’s BRT proved that direct services in a closed system with Gold Standard BRT infrastructure 
and properly sized stations can reach very high capacity and speed with high customer service levels. 
Guangzhou’s peak-hour, single-direction passenger flows, at over 27,000 passengers per hour per direction 
(PPHPD), are double all but the best trunk-and-feeder BRT systems in the world.

Figure 6.13 provides a map of the services for the Guangzhou BRT system. The BRT routes illustrated 
in Figure 6.13 are allowed to operate along the BRT trunk corridor. The physically segregated busways 
and prepaid boarding stations were built along the trunk corridor illustrated in this figure, which also 
shows the bike-sharing stations implemented along the BRT corridor. Although the trunk corridor is only 
23 kilometers long, BRT service coverage extends to 273 kilometers of roadways in the city.

\figure[medium]{assets/image14.jpeg}{Vehicles operating on the BRT system in Guangzhou move directly from an 
exclusive busway to feeder routes, and thus greatly reduce the need for transfers. This image also shows 
bike-sharing stations implemented along the BRT corridor, and the city’s metro stations. Image}{ ITDP.}

\subsection{Trunk-and-Feeder Services}

Until recently, the most famous BRT systems operated “trunk-and-feeder” or “trunk-only” services. In 
some cases, a new BRT service will run only up and down the BRT trunk infrastructure. This would be called 
a “trunk-only” service. Trunk-only services can either allow the previous routes to continue to operate 
in mixed-traffic lanes parallel to the BRT corridor, and then continue as the route extends past, or 
they can be rerouted off the corridor, or they can be eliminated and force their former customers to 
transfer to the new BRT. The approach of allowing former bus routes to continue in mixed traffic is what 
occurred in Jakarta, Indonesia, and in many Chinese systems. It has the advantage that it does not force 
customers to transfer against their will. These systems have the disadvantage that the ridership of the 
BRT system tends to be lower, undermining returns to scale in the BRT system operation. Also, as it leaves 
many bus routes in the mixed traffic lanes, this approach also tends to degrade the level of service 
in the mixed traffic lanes, resulting in lowered mixed traffic speeds due to increased congestion. 

Initially, trunk-and-feeder service design was the result of BRT system developers copying the service 
characteristics of rail systems without considering direct service alternatives that were possible with 
BRT. Often, designers of “trunk-only” services think that informal operators will automatically provide 
feeder services to the trunk routes. In some cases, where enforcement and regulation of informal operators 
is reasonably effective, this can bring some customers to the trunk system, though it normally forces 
customers to pay twice, and does little to improve the quality of the trip still being performed by the 
informal part of the service. More typically, however, informal operators will refuse to stop at trunk 
stations in an effort to retain their customers for the longer haul trip, draining the BRT system of 
ridership and revenue, and congesting parallel mixed-traffic lanes. 

TransJakarta remained for many years a “trunk” system without a “feeder.” As a result, despite being 
one of the longest BRT systems in the world at over 172 kilometers, in early 2012 it carried only 350,000 
customers per day and about 4,000 customers per hour per direction at peak times. Roughly two-thirds 
of all public transport customers using the TransJakarta corridors continued to use their former bus 
routes and operate in very congested mixed traffic conditions. While some operational improvements have 
been made, and a few new direct services have been added, the system has yet to fully optimize its services 
and operates at a loss. 

Mexico City also operates a trunk-only system. Rather than allowing former bus routes to operate in 
parallel, it cancelled them, reducing mixed traffic congestion and pushing up ridership on Metrobús. 
The new routing did not cause that many new forced transfers, because most of the former bus routes were 
already organized to operate on corridors in a manner that was not fully consistent with demand pattern. 
As the Mexico City system expanded, inter-corridor routes were added, and the system began to serve more 
customers, while reducing unnecessary transfers and station saturation.

The better systems, such as Bogotá’s TransMilenio, Curitiba’s system, Rio’s Transoeste, Lima’s Metropolitano, 
and others provide fully integrated feeder bus services that connect to the trunk services in formal 
transfer terminals, offering a better quality and more comprehensive door-to-door service than the trunk-only 
services. In this case, a former bus route that overlaps the trunk BRT corridor for only part of its 
route is split into two services: a trunk service operating only inside the BRT system, and a feeder 
route that operates in mixed traffic. 

In the best systems, the BRT system operator operates both trunk services and feeder services under 
professional quality of service contracts with private vehicle operating companies. Such feeder services 
are not operated by informal operators, but by modern companies, and they form an integral part of the 
BRT system, with consistent branding, fare systems, information technology, and other BRT amenities. 
In some cases, especially in higher-income countries, a public transport authority is likely to operate 
both a BRT trunk service with special vehicles and branding, and a feeder service using normal buses 
in mixed-traffic lanes that are unlikely to be identified as part of the BRT system.

\subsection{ Services That Skip Stops: Limited, Express, Early Return, and Deadheading}

The most basic type of public transport service along a corridor is typically known as “local service.” 
This term refers to a service where stops are made at each station along a route. Thus, while local services 
provide the most complete route coverage along a corridor, such services also result in the longest travel 
times and the slowest speeds.

Each stop a vehicle makes adds some delay. One of the easiest ways to increase vehicle speeds is to 
add services that skip stations. Services that skip a few stations at regular intervals are usually called 
“limited stop services.” Services that skip many stations are generally called “express services.” One 
of the main advantages of BRT is that it is relatively simple and inexpensive to allow one vehicle to 
pass another by simply having passing lanes at station stops. 

\figure{assets/image19.jpeg}{Passing lanes at stations, like these in Bogotá, allow for
the provision of express and limited stop services.}{ Karl Fjellstrom.}

\figure{assets/image20.jpeg}{Passing lanes prevent queue formation at stations in  São 
Paulo, deliver significant travel time savings to customers.}{ Karl Fjellstrom, ITDP China.}

Single-track metro and light rail transit (LRT) systems and simple, single-lane BRT systems like TransJakarta 
and RIT Curitiba (except for the new Linea Verde), which do not have passing lanes, have few options 
but to operate only local services. There are no provisions within the infrastructure of these systems 
for vehicles to pass one another. Allowing passing in the infrastructure design can provide more service 
options and is a main reason why *The* *BRT Standard* weighs heavily the inclusion of passing lanes in 
the design.

Many of the examples in this chapter assume that it is possible to build physical infrastructure that 
can accommodate the passing of one service by another, generally through the inclusion of passing lanes 
inside the BRT infrastructure. The best solution is to simply provide enough space for passing lanes 
at station stops. The space is not needed along the entire corridor, only at stations that can be set 
back from the intersection to avoid compromising intersection capacity. When right-of-way for passing 
lanes is simply unattainable, figuring out how to accommodate passing to allow longer distance limited 
and express vehicles to pass local BRT services and still use the dedicated BRT infrastructure is a challenge. 
A variety of alternatives have been discussed, though with fairly limited application to date. Most of 
these techniques only work up to a certain maximum frequency.  

If the barrier between the busway and the mixed-traffic lanes is not rigid and can be easily permeated, 
it is possible for express and limited buses to simply pass each other in the mixed-traffic lanes. This 
is often done in bus system improvements like Select Bus Service in New York, but so far there are no 
examples of this in full BRT systems. Its effectiveness depends on the degree of mixed traffic congestion 
at the critical points where the buses need to pass one another. 

Another technique is to time services so that limited stop or express services only catch up with the 
local services at the terminal point of a route, or at select stations where passing lanes are available. 
Such services, called “catch up” services, are more commonly seen in rail systems. Thus, an express service 
may begin ten minutes behind a local service, and this starting-time difference ensures that the express 
service does not overtake the local service. Such an approach may be applicable to BRT for relatively 
short corridors with relatively long headways (e.g., ten minutes), but to date there is limited experience, 
and its application has been limited to express-service demands only. 

Some cities have considered adding a pull-by bay in front of stations, where a local BRT vehicle can 
pull aside and let an express bus pass. This solution has the benefit of only requiring right-of-way 
where it is least needed for other purposes, such as BRT stations or turning lanes. Some preliminary 
analysis indicated that pull-by bays at some stations might be feasible in systems with headways greater 
than about five minutes, but there remains limited real-world experience with their application. 

If the BRT infrastructure does not include passing lanes at station stops, it may be advisable to leave 
express services in mixed traffic lanes. Curitiba’s RIT system, for instance, excluded longer-distance 
express buses from BRT services due to the lack of passing lanes. This was a second-best solution, the 
benefits of which degraded as traffic congestion increased in the mixed-traffic lanes. One of the main 
innovations of Bogotá’s TransMilenio was to introduce express, limited, and local services, all inside 
the BRT infrastructure.      

Sometimes the overabundance of stops is mitigated by stop-on-demand. Stop-on-demand does not work well 
during peak hours, however, as there is usually demand for all of the stops. It is also virtually incompatible 
with BRT services. Since stop-on-demand offers limited benefits during the critical peak period, and 
does not integrate well with BRT, it is generally not used in BRT services and hence is not further considered 
here. 

In many developing-nation cities, public transport services operate on a hail-and-ride basis. Even 
in cities in the United States, minibus services effectively stop wherever hailed by a customer, whether 
at a bus shelter or not. This has the advantage of minimizing walking times. Hail-and-ride vehicles may 
also offer a variety of service options and very high frequency. Hail-and-ride services are not compatible 
with operations inside a BRT system, though it is possible to allow hail-and-ride services to continue 
to operate in mixed-traffic lanes and to continue to provide services to locations where stops have been 
removed. Hail-and-ride is also not further considered herein.

“Early return” services are another form of service that eliminates stops, in this case from the extreme 
ends of the route. Typically, the highest-demand segment of a route is in the city center, so early return 
services only operate the service on the highest demand part of the BRT corridor, allowing other services 
to operate on the full length of the corridor. With a limited fleet of vehicles, these early return services 
will significantly reduce operating costs for the system operator, while reducing the fleet size, but 
the demand profile needs to allow this type of service. 

“Deadheading” is when buses are run without stopping for customers in the nonpeak direction. Because 
demand frequently varies in the two directions of a BRT service, the optimal frequency is likely to differ 
for the two directions. Full optimization of services therefore requires the programming of services 
separately for the two directions. TransMilenio, in fact, coded the different directions with different 
route numbers, and these routes had different stopping patterns optimized to the specific peak and contra-peak 
demand patterns. It is often more efficient to run some of the buses in the contra-peak flow direction 
to skip more stops or to not stop at all, allowing the bus to return more quickly to the peak flow direction. 
This is known as deadheading.

\subsection{ Speed, Travel Time, and Distance Relationships}

Frequently, a BRT route’s length and travel time will be known, but not the average speed, or the average 
speed and time but not the distance. These are the basic relationships:\' TODO Math:'\ 

$$ \text{average speed} = {\text{travel distance} \over \text{travel time}} \Leftrightarrow \text{travel time} =  {\text{travel distance} \over \text{average speed}} \Leftrightarrow  \text{travel distance} = {\text{travel time} * \text{average speed}} $$


\beginbox{Reminder for time units conversion}

1 hour = 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds;

1 day = 24 hours = 1,440 minutes = 86,400 seconds
\endbox

Most commonly, one calculates the length of a proposed or existing route (usually the transit authority 
knows the route length, or it can be taken from GTFS, or calculated using GPS on board the bus), and 
usually a speed survey is conducted so that several peak hour trips can be timed and the average taken, 
so one can calculate existing bus speeds by using the above formula.  

If a trip takes one hour, and the distance is 20 kilometers, the speed is 20 kph. As the best BRT systems 
in urban conditions tend to move about 20 kph for a single track BRT and up to 30 kph for a BRT with 
passing lanes and sub-stops, if existing bus speeds are well below 20 kph, we know there is a reasonable 
likelihood of improving the speed on the route. 

\subsection{ Peak Hour, Peak Hour Ridership, Peak Hour Travel Time, Peak Hour Speed}

Most service planning decisions require a calculation of the peak hour, or the hour of the day when 
there are the most public transport customers using the system on a particular route. It is also often 
important to estimate the speed on the route.   

How the peak hour is determined depends on what data is most readily available. In the United States, 
where it is fairly common to have transit agency data with boarding, alighting, and time at each bus 
stop (or at least each link), a chart like Table 6.2 can be created. It will show the total 6:00 a.m. 
departure for Route “A,” the 6:15 a.m. departure, and so on. The total boardings per vehicle are then 
calculated for each departing vehicle on Route A, and the total travel time for each Route A departure.

In Table 6.3, the peak hour for Route “A” is from 6:15 a.m. to 7:14 a.m. It is during this hour that 
total boardings of all Route A trips reach their maximum. 

Alternatively, if this data is not available, the peak hour can be calculated from frequency and occupancy 
counts for each bus route. In this case, a surveyor would stand at the critical link (highest demand 
section of the route) and count the number of Route “A” buses and estimate their occupancy. The hour 
with the maximum frequency and highest occupancy is roughly the peak hour. 

In the example above, the peak hour headway is fifteen minutes and peak-hour frequency is four minutes. 
The average peak hour demand per bus is twenty-five, or a hundred per hour, and the average travel time 
is 1:55. When inputting this data into a model (for calculating costs, benefits, stations, bus sizes, 
fleets, travel times, or simulating the network), one generally converts the above messy data into a 
constant flow that represents average peak hour conditions.

It is these averages that will tend to be used in a traffic model. The 
existing speed of the bus route should be used to code the link speed for the existing public transport 
route.

\subsection{ Public Transport Loads: Load, Critical Link, Maximum Hourly Load on the Critical Link (MaxLoad), Passengers per Hour per Direction (PPHPD), and Load Factor}

The “load” of a given segment (or link) of a system is the total number of customers that travel through 
that segment within a given time period, usually an hour; if no other qualification is made it refers 
to “passengers per hour across the given segment”; this, like other measures presented, changes throughout 
the day (and from one day to the next), but for the service planning exercises presented in this chapter, 
if nothing else is said, the load of a segment refers to the peak hour load.

Once the peak hour load has been calculated (as in Section 6.3.6), the 
consolidated boardings, alightings, and loads at each stop on the planned BRT corridor can be calculated 
by simply adding up the hourly boardings and alightings of all the routes that will use the new BRT corridor, 
as illustrated above. In Table 6.5, the maximum load is thirty-four and it occurs after the bus departs 
the 70th Street Station until it reaches the 80th Street Station. The link between 70th Street and 80th 
Street is carrying the heaviest load of customers, and as such is called the “Critical Link.” The load 
on this link (thirty-four in Table 6.5) is known as the “maximum load on the critical link.”

Note that this is usually only for one direction of travel. To avoid confusion due to the fact that 
a segment normally has two directions, it is common for the unit PPHPD to be used for the expression 
of loads. It is an abbreviation for “passengers per hour per direction” and it means “passengers per 
hour in one direction.” PPHPD (or even *pphpd*) is used here with this intended meaning.

\figure[medium]{assets/image24.png}{Output of a boarding and alighting survey for bus route 248R in Guangzhou, 
China, during the peak hour. The "Critical Link" is between Stop 13 and Stop 16. Graph}{ ITDP.}

Figure 6.20 illustrates the same idea graphically. The link between Stop 13 and Stop 16 carries the 
heaviest load, so it is the critical link, and the maximum load on this critical link is about 1,800 
passengers per hour per direction (or PPHPD). The maximum load on the critical link is of primary interest 
to BRT system planners, as it is used for making many crucial design and service planning decisions. 
The duration of one hour is considered the appropriate measure of peak duration (shorter measurements 
have considerable oscillation). In the formulas that follow, this peak load is called the “maximum hourly 
load on the critical link” (MaxLoad). Identifying this location and this load is paramount in any service 
planning exercise as it is the load at this point that will determine the fleet needed and the appropriate 
vehicle size. The expressions *corridor maximum load* and eventually *system maximum load* also refer 
to this measurement. 

The “load factor” is the percentage of a vehicle’s total capacity that is actually occupied. For example, 
if a vehicle has a maximum capacity of 160 customers and 128 customers in a segment of a trip, then the 
load factor is 80 percent (128 divided by 160) on that given segment. The total load factor of the system 
would account for the average load for all services throughout the system (this average could be weighted 
by segment extension or time vehicles need to cross it), and it is used to show the efficiency with which 
the system’s vehicles are used. When the term *load factor* is used without further qualification, it 
refers to the *design load factor*—that is, the planned average load factor to happen on the busiest 
segment of the service, or the critical link, when the system is implemented as discussed in the following 
paragraphs.

The actual load factors of any BRT system are determined by the frequency of the vehicles, the capacity 
of the vehicles, and the demand. In a service plan, the load factor is easily altered by changing the 
frequency of the services, changing the vehicle size, or changing the routes of competing services. Designing 
services using a lower load factor than the real capacity of the vehicle is recommended. 

While systems with high load factors tend to be more profitable, generally it is not advisable to plan 
to operate at a load factor of 100 percent. If designing for 100 percent load, 50 percent or more of 
the vehicles will be overcrowded, because the distribution of customers will never be uniform from vehicle 
to vehicle, but will likely be some variation within 10 to 20 percent of the design load factor. Even 
if the vehicles were at capacity and not overcrowded, the conditions in the vehicle will be uncomfortable 
to customers, as well as create negative consequences for operations. At 100 percent capacity, small 
system delays or inefficiencies, especially with boarding and alighting, can lead to severe overcrowding 
conditions. 

The desired load factor may vary between peak and nonpeak periods. In Bogotá’s TransMilenio system, 
typical load factors are 80 percent for peak periods and 70 percent for nonpeak periods. However, as 
ridership levels increase in Bogotá, overcrowding becomes an increasing concern. 

The load factor is unlikely to be uniform for the entirety of a route. Designing services that maintain 
high load factors for as much of the route as possible will tend to improve system performance and efficiency, 
including its financial performance. 

A system’s capacity is considered to be met when the load factor reaches 100 percent at the maximum 
load on the critical link. Systems can also sometimes operate at a load factor exceeding 100 percent, 
but not by much, and such a system would be considered to be operating at “above capacity.” BRT system 
capacity is generally measured by the peak PPHPD. This measurement would be taken at the point of the 
maximum load on the critical link\highlight{. }

TransMilenio has a capacity of about 36,000 PPHPD based on its service plan, but its peak PPHPD has 
been counted as over 40,000. Such a level implies that customers are more closely packed than the maximum 
recommended levels. This situation is sometimes known as the “crush capacity.” While such extreme capacities 
can be expected in some unusual circumstances (e.g., immediately after special events such as sporting 
events or concerts), it is not desirable to regularly overcrowd vehicles. 

\subsection{ Service Frequency and Headways}

The service frequency refers to the number of times a specific service is offered during a given time 
interval. Normally, frequency is expressed per hour, but service frequencies can also be expressed for 
any time interval, such as: “ten trips per day” or “twenty trips per three-hour peak period,” or even 
“a quarter of a trip per minute.” As with everything else in BRT service planning, frequency of service 
(existing or planned) changes throughout the day, but the sizing of the system should be based on the 
frequency during the peak hour. So, if no further mention is made, frequency means “the number of services 
provided in one hour, during the peak.” 

The time between two vehicles offering a service, which conveys exactly the same information as frequency, 
is known as the “headway.” Headways can be expressed as, for example: “one trip every two hours” or as 
“one trip every ninety minutes” or “one trip every thirty seconds.” The characteristic of headway measuring 
is that time is referenced to *one bus trip*\highlight{.}

Based on the concept definitions, the below equations are always true (mathematical identities).

Eq. 6.1: 

$$ \text{Freq} = {1 \over \text{hdwy}}  \Leftrightarrow  \text{hdwy} = {1 \over \text{Freq}}  $$

Where:
\item $$\text{Freq}$$: Service frequency; that is number of times a specific service is offered during a given time 
interval;
\item $$\text{hdwy}$$: Service headway, that is time between two vehicles offering a service.

The service headway is the inverse of the frequency, but beware of units used for each one; for example: 
four buses per hour implies a headway of ¼ of hour, i.e., a headway of fifteen minutes. So the service 
headway in minutes is calculated as sixty divided by the frequency in hours and the frequency (in hours) 
is calculated as sixty divided by the headway in minutes.

The “minimum frequency” is the frequency that is needed to provide enough capacity to satisfy the existing 
demand without the average peak hour bus having a load factor above a policy-determined norm, usually 
85 percent. 

When planning services, if the vehicle size has already been determined, and an acceptable maximum 
load factor has been determined (normally 85 percent), then the minimum frequency can be determined based 
on the following formula:  

Eq. 6.2:  

$$ \text{Freq} = {\text{MaxLoad} \over {V_\text{Size} * \text{LoadFactor}}} $$

Where:
\item $$\text{Freq}$$:  Service frequency; the number of times a specific service is offered during a given time 
interval;
\item $$\text{MaxLoad}$$: Maximum hourly load on the critical link;
\item $$V_\text{Size}$$: Vehicle capacity;
\item $$\text{LoadFactor}$$: Percentage of a vehicle’s total capacity that is actually occupied.

For example, if the bus specification has already been determined to have a capacity of 150 customers 
per vehicle, and the maximum hourly load on the critical link is 3,000, and the maximum acceptable load 
factor is 85 percent, or if: 

$$ \text{MaxLoad} = 2550 $$;

$$ \text V_\text{Size} = 150; $$

$$ \text{LoadFactor} = 85 \% $$

Then:  

$$ F = {2550 \over {150 \times 0.85} } =  20 $$

And if $$F = 20$$, then the headway is $$ {60 \text{(minutes)} \over {20}} = 3\text{(minutes)} $$

In general, it is desirable to provide frequent services in order to reduce customer waiting times. 
At headways of ten minutes or longer, customers will no longer have confidence that they can just show 
up at the station at any time and a bus will come in a reasonable period of time. With headways longer 
than 10 minutes, customers tend to view the system as a timetable service, which leads to loss of ridership. 
In Mexibus corridor III, illegal services operating parallel to the corridor serve most of the demand 
in off-peak hours.

In low demand systems where authorities want to promote increased public transport ridership, they 
sometimes set frequency based on a policy decision rather than on the minimum frequency. As very low 
demand routes are quite common in the developed world, it is often the case that frequency is set as 
a matter of policy rather than as a function of capacity. Services operating at frequencies higher than 
can be justified by the demand, however, are likely to contribute to operating deficits. 

\figure{assets/image25.jpeg}{The perception of a relatively empty busway next to heavily congested 
mixed-traffic lanes, as seen in this image of Guangzhou can 
create political pressures. Images}{ ITDP.}

\figure{assets/image26.jpeg}{Despite carrying far more passengers per lane than a car lane, this buswayi, in Jakarta, can also be perceived as empty.}{ITDP.}

On a BRT system, a corridor with relatively high frequency should have been chosen, so the chances 
are that frequencies will rarely drop below six in any case. But what appears as high frequency in mixed 
traffic appears as low frequency on a busway. A five-minute frequency in mixed traffic is very high; 
on a busway, it is comparatively low. A busway with a headway of five minutes will appear empty most 
of the time to motorists sitting in traffic congestion. The lower the frequency, the greater the likelihood 
that motorists will complain that the road is being underutilized. Such complaints can ultimately undermine 
political support for future busways. In Quito, pressure from motorist organizations led the national 
police to open up exclusive busway corridors to mixed traffic for a period of time in 2006. This was 
also the case in León, Mexico in 2008. This conversion occurred despite the fact that each busway lane 
was moving three to four times the volume of customers as a mixed traffic lane. Nevertheless, the perception 
of an empty busway next to heavily congested mixed-traffic lanes can create political difficulties. A 
similar political battle has been fought over the BRT corridor in Indore, India.

On the other hand, if headways are very low, and frequency is very high, congestion at the station 
and service irregularity become a risk. Figure 6.23 illustrates the relationship between service frequency 
and congestion. 

\figure{assets/image27.jpeg}{Service frequency and the potential impact on vehicle velocity at a station 
with no passing lanes. Graph}{ Steer Davies Gleave.}

Service irregularity (bus bunching) is an even greater risk with higher frequency. For these reasons, 
it is usually advisable to split a service into two distinct services (for example, one limited and one 
express) if the frequency rises above 30 vehicles per hour.  

\subsection{ Dwell Time}

One of the main aims of BRT system design and service planning is to reduce the delay caused by vehicles 
slowing down to stop at stations, allowing the customers to board and alight, and then to accelerate 
to a free-flow speed. The entirety of this delay is known as “total dwell time,” or Td, in this chapter’s 
equations.

The dwell time consists of two separate types of delay: “fixed dwell time” ($$T_0$$) and “variable dwell 
time.” In BRT system planning, it is critical to keep these two causes of delay distinct, because different 
decisions will affect different types of dwell time. Fixed dwell time, also called “dead time,” is the 
time consumed by a vehicle slowing down on approaching a station, opening its doors (and after a variable 
dwell time for boarding and alighting), closing its doors, and then regaining free-flow speed. This delay 
is called fixed dwell time because it does not vary with the number of customers boarding and alighting 
at each stop, and it does not vary much between stops in a system. The only way to reduce fixed dwell 
time is to remove stopping at particular stations in the service design, by offering express or limited 
stop services or eliminating the stop from the system. 

In some countries, it is more typical to model fixed dwell time as only the time at the station when 
a bus is opening and closing its doors, and the time consumed accelerating and decelerating on the approach 
to the stop is modeled as a reduction in the link speed between station stops. It is important to keep 
in mind that this guide, when it talks of fixed dwell time, refers to both.   

Variable dwell time consists of customer boarding time ($$T_b$$) and alighting time ($$T_a$$). Because it varies 
with the number of customers boarding and alighting at a given station, it is called “variable dwell 
time,” ($$ T_b + T_a$$ or $$max(T_a, T_b)$$ depending on the vehicle/system configuration).   

Many key elements of BRT that are recognized by *The* *BRT* *Standard* are measures that will tend 
to reduce variable dwell time, such as:  
\item Number of vehicle doorways;
\item Width of vehicle doorways;
\item Level boarding;
\item Fare collection outside the vehicle.

BRT systems are able to operate metro-like service in large part due to the ability to reduce dwell 
time per customer from an average of five or six seconds per passenger for a typical bus service to only 
0.3 seconds per customer on a Gold Standard BRT. 

\subsection{ Renovation Factor}

The renovation factor ($$\text{Ren}$$) is total demand of a bus route divided by the load on the critical link 
of that route (note that operators customarily use the vehicle capacity instead of load on the critical 
link). It is the multiplier used to convert the number of customers that one would observe travelling 
on a route at the critical link (for example, in a vehicle occupancy survey) into the total number of 
customers on the route. Higher renovation factors are seen when there are many short trips along the 
line; corridors with very high renovation factor rates are more profitable because the same number of 
total paying customers is handled with fewer vehicles. For example, the Insurgentes corridor in Mexico 
City has a recorded renovation factor of five, which means that there are five times more people getting 
on and off the vehicle as there are people on the vehicle at the most loaded time.

Corridors with very high renovation factors meet higher demand more easily than corridors with low 
renovation factors, simply because more people are getting on and off vehicles along the corridor after 
shorter rides, so more people can be served. 

Eq. 6.3:

$$\text{Ren}_\text{route} = {D_\text{route} \over \text{MaxLoad}_\text{route}}$$ 

Where:
\item $$\text{Ren}_\text{route}$$: Renovation factor of a route;
\item $$D_\text{route}$$: Route demand (in passengers);
\item $$\text{MaxLoad}_\text{route}$$: Route demand on the critical link.

    \subsection{ Irregularity Index (Irr)}

The irregularity index is a number that expresses the reliability of actual headways against scheduled 
headways. An irregularity index of one means that the vehicles are arriving at completely random times, 
and an irregularity index of zero means that vehicles are arriving precisely when they are scheduled. 
It is measured as: 

Eq. 6.4: 

$$ \text{Irr} = {\text{Variance of the headway} \over {\text{Scheduled headway}} ^2 } $$ 

Where:
\item $$\text{Irr}$$: Irregularity index, the measure of the variance between the actual headways and the scheduled 
headways;
\item $$\text{Variance of the headway}$$: Amount that the headways are spread out;
\item $$\text{Scheduled}_text{headway}$$:  Average waiting time between vehicles.

Variance of the headway is statistically defined as the expected value of the squared deviation from 
the mean headway. When calculating it from a sample it would be equal to the sum of the square of the 
differences between each observed headway and the average headway divided by the number of observations 
minus one, given by:

Eq. 6.5: 

$$V_\text{hdwy} = {\sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{obs}} (\text{hdwy}_i - \text{hdwy}_\text{average}) ^ 2 \over {N_\text{obs} - 1}} $$ 

Where:

\item $$V_\text{hdwy}$$:  Variance of the headway, expected value of the squared deviation from the mean headway;
\item $$N_\text{obs}$$: Number of observed headways;
\item $$\text{hdwy}_i$$: Observed headway for “i”;
\item $$\text{hdwy}_\text{average}$$: Average headway, average waiting time between vehicles = scheduled headway.

The average headway will generally be equal to the scheduled headway, unless fewer trips than scheduled 
regularly occur. Consider the extreme case where we should have one bus every twenty minutes every hour 
during ten hours, which would be thirty buses throughout the day (or three buses per hour for ten hours), 
and imagine that the first bus was on time and the other twenty-nine arrive one after another in the 
last half hour of the tenth hour. The headway of the first bus would be 571 minutes and the other 29 
would be 1 minute, so on average the headway would still be 20 minutes per bus (600 minutes divided by 
30 buses). Without an operational control system, empirical observation indicates that under many conditions, 
the irregularity index is around 0.3. 

\subsection{ Cycle Time-Related Concepts: Cycle Time (TC) and Maximum Demand Load per Cycle Time (MaxLoadperCycle) }

Assuming that a vehicle will keep repeating a service (in both directions, or as a circular route), 
cycle time is the amount of time that it takes for a bus to travel the entire length of its route, in 
both directions, and be ready to begin a second circuit, including any time waiting and reversing direction 
at the end points. It is extremely important to know the cycle time per route for service planning. If 
a cycle time is short, the same bus can rapidly come back to the beginning of the route and take a second 
load of customers. If the cycle time is long, additional buses will be needed. Knowing the cycle time 
is therefore necessary for determining the required fleet. 

When proposing an initial service plan, one should already have the existing route travel times in 
mixed traffic. In order to estimate the cycle time for the proposed routes, one must replace the travel 
time inside the BRT structure assuming a typical speed (say 20 kph if the corridor is in a dense downtown 
area, or 29 kph if it is on a limited-access high-speed arterial with few intersections). In the next 
chapter, methods of calculating more refined projected speeds will be presented, but for this chapter, 
these baseline speeds will be assumed for inside the BRT trunk operations.

It should be noted that drivers must have some rest time at the end of the route; in short routes this 
can be done once per cycle. Even if it would be possible to reduce the time to turn the vehicle by changing 
drivers, the practice is to have the driver always using the same vehicle, which eases operations management 
and fleet maintenance as well as improving the quality of driving.

Once the cycle time is estimated for each planned service, it is possible to estimate the Maximum Demand 
Load per Cycle Time\highlight{ }(MaxLoadperCycle). This is the number of customers that are likely to 
accumulate over the course of the cycle time expecting to cross the critical link of the route. In other 
words, how many customers will accumulate for a specific route at the critical link over a time period 
equal to the cycle time? This figure, which can be calculated from the surveys of existing routes, is 
critical in several calculations in service planning. This figure is basically the same thing as the 
number of customer places that need to be serviced with vehicles, and is sometimes identified as “passenger 
places served.”\highlight{ }It can be thought of as the size of the vehicle that would be needed if only 
one vehicle were used to service the peak hour demand. 

For planning purposes, it is critical to know the peak load demand on a typical day over the course 
of a single cycle time (also during the peak period). If demand is reasonably constant throughout the 
day, and one can assume that hourly MaxLoad is constant, then MaxLoadperCycle would be estimated by:

Eq. 6.6a: 

$$ \text{MaxLoadperCycle} = \text{MaxLoad} *\text{TC} $$

Where:
\item $$ \text{MaxLoadperCycle}$$: Maximum demand load per cycle time;
\item $$ \text{MaxLoad}$$: Maximum hourly load on the critical link;
\item $$ \text{TC}$$: Cycle time in hours.

However, demand is rarely constant before and after the peak hour, nor even during the peak hour. If 
demand is at its peak, then the maximum demand load per cycle time will appear higher for an increment 
of time shorter than an hour than if it is averaged over an hour. For a cycle time longer than an hour, 
the maximum demand load for the cycle time will appear to be lower than for the peak hour because it 
is being averaged over a longer period of time during which the demand has already fallen. The more demand 
is peaked, the greater the distortion.

Therefore, to be more accurate, one has to apply a correction factor:
\item Increases demand if the cycle time is shorter than one hour;
\item Decreases demand if the cycle time is longer than one hour.

One way to apply such a correction is using the formula below:

Eq. 6.6b with “peak hour to cycle correction factor” (PHtoCC): 

$$ \text{MaxLoadperCycle} = \text{MaxLoad} * TC * [ 1 - \text{PHtoCC} * (\text{TC} -1) ] $$

 Where:
\item[$$\text{PHtoCC}$$: Nonnegative correction factor, the calibration of which is based on survey data, is discussed in Box 6.2. The usual value is near 0.1;
\item If $$\text{TC}$$  is larger than one hour: correction $$ 1 - \text{PHtoCC} * (\text{TC} -1) $$ will result smaller than one;
\item If $$\text{TC}$$ is smaller than one hour: correction $$ 1 - \text{PHtoCC} * (\text{TC} -1) $$ will result larger than one;
\item If $$\text{TC}$$ is equal one hour: correction $$   1 - \text{PHtoCC} * (\text{TC} -1) $$ will result in one;
\item If $$\text{PHtoCC}$$ is equal zero, there will be no correction, and the formula is equal to the previous formula.]

\subsection{ Waiting Time (Twait) and Waiting Time Cost (Costwait)}

Throughout this chapter it will be necessary to compare the relative costs and benefits of different 
service planning scenarios. One of the most important costs to consider in service planning is the cost 
of time spent waiting by customers. 

Assuming customers arrive randomly at a bus stop, the average waiting time for a customer is only half 
of the observed headway of the route. Hence, the wait time per customer is the headway multiplied by 
0.5, plus a little extra if there is irregularity in the actual headways from scheduled service (Irr). 
The equation below expresses this, replacing headway with frequency (its inverse value).

Eq. 6.7: 

$$ T_\text{wait}= 0.5 * (1 + \text{Irr}_\text{route}) * \text{hdwy} = {0.5 * (1 + \text{Irr}_\text{route}) \over \text{Freq}}$$

Where:
\item $$T_\text{wait}$$: Time spent waiting per customer;
\item $$\text{Irr}$$: Irregularity index; measure of the variance between the actual headways and the scheduled headways 
(usually near 0.3, see Section 6.3.9);
\item $$\text{hdwy}$$: Route Headway;
\item $$\text{Freq}$$: Route Frequency.

The cost of waiting ($$\text{Cost}_\text{wait}$$) is defined as the amount an average customer would spend to avoid waiting 
for a vehicle, it is measured in currency per unit of time—for example: “5 Rp. per minute” and “6 US$ 
per hour”—and is calculated as a fraction of customer income. Costwait varies depending on a city’s income 
and proclivity, but typically, people value their time at about one-third of the average wage rate, and 
are willing to pay twice as much to avoid waiting for a vehicle (i.e., 66 percent of the average user 
wage). 

Customers do not like to wait for a vehicle. If the demand of a given route proposed on a service plan 
is known (initially it can be approximated by using the demand on a similar existing route), the total 
waiting cost caused by a route is the sum of the cost of waiting time imposed on all its customers (assuming 
for now that this is captive demand), then multiplied by their value of waiting time: 


Eq. 6.8a: 

$$\text{WaitCost}_\text{route} = \text{D}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait}*\text{T}_\text{wait}$$ 

Where:

\item $$\text{WaitCost}_\text{Route}$$: Total waiting time cost for the users of the route (in US$);
\item $$\text{D}_\text{route}$$: Route demand (in passengers);
\item $$ \text{Cost}_\text{wait}$$: Average user waiting cost ($/time);
\item $$\text{T}_\text{wait}$$: Average user waiting time (time/passenger).

This is the total cost of waiting faced by all the customers on a particular route during the peak 
hour. The average value of waiting as defined is the same all day. 

The $$\text{D}_\text{route}$$ formula for estimating the cost of waiting on the route would be more usefully expressed 
as a function of the maximum load on the critical link and of the route frequency because normally one 
has a sense of where the most crowded link on a public transport route is, and one can count the number 
of buses per hour, and estimate their occupancy from vehicle frequency and occupancy counts. One might 
know the total ridership on one route, but not all of them, so one can estimate the total demand on the 
corridor for all the routes by using an average renovation rate on the corridor. To do this, the formula 
can be rewritten as follows:

Eq. 6.3 can be rewritten: 

$$\text{Ren}_\text{route} = {{D}_\text{route} \over \text{MaxLoad}_\text{route}}  \Leftrightarrow  \text{D}_\text{route} = \text{MaxLoad}_\text{route} * \text{Ren}_\text{route}$$ 

This is simply true by definition. Remember that the renovation rate of the route is by definition 
the total demand on the route divided by the maximum load on the critical link, or that the demand on 
the route is a function of the maximum load on the critical link multiplied by the renovation rate. 

We can then replace Droute and Twait from Equation 6.2 and Equation 6.6 in Equation 6.7, so that we 
have:

Eq. 6.8b: 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} = \text{D}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * \text{T}_\text{wait}$$ 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route}= {\text{MaxLoad}_\text{route} *\text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5  * (1 + \text{Irr}_\text{route}) \over \text{Freq}_\text{route} }$$ 

Where:
\item $$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route}$$ = Total waiting time cost generated to the route users (now in $/hour because instead 
of giving Droute absolute value in passengers, it is being given in passengers/hour);
\item $$ \text{Ren}_\text{route}$$: Renovation factor of a route;
\item $$ \text{MaxLoadroute}$$: Route demand on the critical link (now in passengers/hour or “pax” per hour);
\item $$ \text{Cost}_\text{wait}$$: Average user waiting cost ($/time);
\item $$ \text{Irr}\text{route}$$: Irregularity index of the route; measure of the variance between the actual headways and 
the scheduled headways (usually near 0.3, see Section 6.3.9);
\item $$\text{Freq}_\text{route}$$: Frequency of the route (vehicles/time).

\subsection{ Vehicle Operating Cost}

Often, in service planning, the costs of waiting for customers, which is a function of the frequency 
and regularity of service, will need to be balanced against the cost of operating more vehicles. As the 
costs of waiting have been calculated for the peak hour above, to make a valid comparison the vehicle 
operating costs should also be derived per hour. The formulas below can be used to estimate cost per 
bus (Costbus) and the fixed cost per bus (BusFixedCost or Costbus-fixed). Vehicle operating cost per 
hour is simply the total cost of operating a vehicle divided by the number of hours a vehicle is in service.

The fixed operating cost of a vehicle is the part of the vehicle operating cost that does not depend 
of the number of customers carried nor the size of the vehicle. It can be thought of as the cost operators 
would incur if they put a second vehicle in operation, but that vehicle never opened its doors and always 
ran empty. It is mostly the cost of the driver, but also the minimum cost in terms of fuel and maintenance 
that any vehicle would incur regardless of its size. This figure is important to calculating the optimal 
fleet size. This part of the cost exists whether one is expressing the costs per route, per vehicle, 
per vehicle hour, or per vehicle kilometer.  

To calculate the total fixed operational cost for a route, simply multiply the fixed operating cost 
per vehicle times the total fleet needed to service that route, or: 

Eq. 6.9: 

$$\text{RouteFixedCost} = \text{BusFixedCost} * \text{Fleet}_\text{route} $$

Where:
\item $$ \text{RouteFixedCost}$$: Total fixed operational cost for the route;
\item $$ \text{BusFixedCost}$$: Fixed operating costs per vehicle;
\item $$ \text{Fleet}_\text{route}$$: Number of buses needed to operate the route.

Total operating cost per vehicle goes down when a stop is removed, as the speed of the vehicles increases. 
As such, total vehicle operating costs are used in Section 6.7 on limited stop services. When optimizing 
the size of the vehicle, as in Section 6.4, as well as when comparing direct against trunk-and-feeder 
services in Section 6.6, it is only the fixed costs of vehicle operation that need to be known because 
it will be necessary to determine the benefits of using larger vehicles, and what is eliminated by using 
larger vehicles is the cost of the vehicle that does not go up proportionally with the size of the vehicle. 
It can be calculated by simply calculating the hourly operating cost of the smallest vehicle in the fleet. 
Typically, this ranges from US$10 to US$100 per bus hour. It will vary from country to country, but 
not much from city to city, so it only needs to be calculated once in a given city or country. The BusFixedCosts 
value consists of a list of average costs per vehicle. Fixed maintenance and fuel costs, which are likely 
to vary somewhat by vehicle size, should be calculated for the smallest vehicle being considered, and 
any additional costs for these will be included in variable costs. In most of this chapter one should 
use a common $$ \text{Cost}_\text{bus-fixed} $$ value of US$30 per vehicle hour.
