\quotation{If you want a happy ending that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.}
{Orson Welles, actor, director, producer, and writer, 1915–1985}

This section addresses the question of whether a new BRT service should retain the same stations as 
preexisting services, and whether limited-stop services should be created. Creating limited-stop services 
is done by means of selecting a proportion of the trips on an existing service and changing the programming 
to skip stops at certain stations: the unchanged service will be referred as the local service and the 
other one or more as a limited-stop service (or express service).

While eliminating stops from the system increases the walking time required by some customers to reach 
a stop, it also increases the average BRT vehicle speed (or “commercial speed”) by removing the fixed 
dwell times at the station. Fixed dwell time (T0 or dead time) is the time associated with the bus pulling 
up to the station, docking, opening and closing its doors, and pulling out of the station. 

In this chapter, the impact of stop removal on variable dwell time is not considered, as it is assumed 
there will not be much change with the elimination of stops, as the ridership will just redistribute 
among the remaining stations.  

Including limited-stop service or services has a variety of impacts. The main advantages of limited-stop 
and express services are:
\item Fixed dwell time is eliminated on the express routes so customers whose origins and destinations 
lie on the limited-stop route will benefit. This is discussed in this section;
\item On high-demand corridors, by dividing a route into local and limited stop, the frequency per route 
is reduced, but also the irregularity of arrivals. This is also treated in this section;
\item By increasing overall system speed, overall system capacity can be increased. This is covered 
in Chapter 7: Capacity and Speed.

However, these services also introduce some costs:
\item Customer waiting times on local routes increase, as the frequency on the original route is reduced;
\item Vehicles must be able to pass one another at stations.

Adding additional services must balance the benefits of removing fixed dwell time with the costs of 
adding customer waiting time, and the costs of deteriorated mixed traffic level of service resulting 
from the need to introduce passing lanes at all stations skipped by limited-stop services.

This section provides guidance to service planners to make decisions about which stations to eliminate 
or add when introducing a BRT system. The first subsection provides a basic methodology for deciding 
when to eliminate a station. It is a simple cost-benefit equation that compares the additional walking 
time to the reduction in fixed dwell time and provides some simple rules of thumb.

The remainder of the section assumes that the local service will be retained, but that additional limited-stop 
services will be created. In all these examples, walking time is no longer an issue, as the local service 
is retained, but at a lower frequency. Rather, it is an issue of balancing the waiting time associated 
with reduced frequencies per route and with the increased bus speeds. It is also a matter of optimizing 
frequencies to reduce the irregularity of service.

Normally, service planners will look at the demand profile of the corridor (an internal O/D to the 
system that also provides the number of customers on board at each link), and using a simulation model, 
will run alternative scenarios to test its benefits and its costs (operation and travel times). Service 
planners generally do not try an infinite number of possible alternatives; they use certain basic approaches 
to determine which scenarios are likely to perform the best, and limit themselves to a reasonable number 
of scenarios. This chapter is aimed at making more transparent the basic thinking that service planners 
use when defining scenarios to test using their simulation models.

\subsection{ Station Spacing and Station Elimination}

When deciding whether to eliminate or add stations, it is necessary to determine what constitutes optimal 
spacing. If stations are spaced very far apart in the manner of a metro system, it is possible to reach 
very high vehicle speeds and system capacities. However, the disadvantage of such an approach is the 
additional time customers must spend to reach the nearest station. Therefore, BRT station spacing should 
try to strike an optimal balance between convenience for walking trips to popular destinations, and convenience 
for customers in the form of higher speed and capacity.

If the origins of customer trips are randomly distributed along a BRT corridor, a standard optimal 
distance between stations can be calculated. In most contexts, it ends up being between 450 meters and 
500 meters, or roughly a quarter mile. 

In Figure 6.59 the optimum station spacing distance is where the total travel time (blue line) is minimized. 
From the figure, this point occurs in the range of a station separation of 400 meters to 500 meters. 


\figure{assets/image80.png}{Optimizing total travel time as a function of station separation, this 
graph illustrates the trade-off faced by customers for increasing distances between station stops. As 
station stop distances increase, in-vehicle time falls as BRT vehicle speeds increase, but walking times 
also increase. Total travel time in a typical urbanized corridor tends to become minimal with stop distances 
around 450 meters. Image}{ Arthur Szász.}

The following formulas can be used to calculate the optimal distance between stations, where the total 
walking cost and travel cost is minimized, or where:

Eq. 6.49

$$ \text{Distance}_\text{optimum} = MIN({C_\text{walk} + C_\text{travel}}) $$

Where:

\item $$ \text{Distance}_\text{optimum} $$: Optimal distance between stations;
\item $$ C_\text{walk}:$$ Walking cost;
\item $$ C_\text{travel}:$$ Travel cost.

Table 6.30 provides an example comparing general travel times for varying station spacings (from 210 
meters to 500 meters) for an average customer trip. In this example, the average customer trip on a corridor 
is 4.35 kilometers. The trade-off between additional walking distances due to fewer stations and time 
spent waiting at stations due to more stations is compared on a per customer basis.

\begintable{Comparison of General Travel Times for Varying Station Spacings}
    \useimage{assets/image81.png}
\endtable

In Table 6.30, the average number of stations per customer trip on the 
corridor is derived by dividing the average trip length by the average distance between stations. This 
is then multiplied by the average fixed dwell time per station to get the average delay per customer 
from the selected station distance.

It is then assumed that each customer walks on average one-quarter of the distance between stations 
at a walking speed of 1.3 meters per second. Boarding customers then have to walk to the station, and 
alighting customers have to walk from the station. This combined walking time then should be weighted 
by a factor of two, because most people dislike walking more than they dislike sitting on a moving bus. 
When these are compared for different stopping distances, the minimum total cost of walking and transiting 
customers occurs at an optimal distance of around .4 or .45 kilometers between stations. This turns out 
to be the optimal spacing when demand along a corridor is relatively uniform.

*The* *BRT Standard* gives 2 points for a system where the average stopping distance between stations 
is 0.3 kilometers and 0.8 kilometers (or between 0.2 miles and 0.5 miles), with 450 being a typical appropriate 
distance between stations. Note, however, that in high-capacity systems with large stations, BRT stations 
may cover an area around 100–250 meters long, and in this case a more reasonable station spacing is around 
600 meters.

Of course, this calculation has been made per customer, rather than for customers in aggregate. Where 
there are large volumes of boarding and alighting customers, more frequent stations will be optimal, 
because more people will be affected by the long walking times than will benefit from the faster vehicle 
speeds. In areas with very few boarding and alighting customers, greater distances between stations will 
be optimal, because fewer people will benefit from the shorter walking distances, and more will benefit 
from the faster vehicle speeds. For this reason, it is fairly typical to have stations spaced at a greater 
distance apart farther from the city center, where demand is lower, and closer together downtown, where 
both demand and the density of trip attractors or generators are higher. Figure 6.59 visually summarizes 
the trade-off between walking times and BRT travel times in relation to the distance between stations. 
 

Further, the optimal distance is not a constant, but will vary depending on a number of factors, including: 
the average trip length (assumed to be 4.35 kilometers in the table above), the average walking speed 
(used 1.2 m/s as a design speed to accommodate the range of walking speeds, but this can vary from city 
to city), the weight that people attribute to walking and urban density. In the table above, a weight 
of two was used, but if, for example, a lot of people are elderly or disabled, or if the walking environment 
is very bad, people might pay more to avoid walking.

A reasonable average stopping distance is around 450 meters for low-capacity stations and 600 meters 
for larger, high-capacity stations. This spacing is the best way to minimize walking distances, while 
keeping vehicle speeds at a reasonable level. BRT stations are typically located near major destinations 
such as commercial centers, large office or residential buildings, educational institutions, major junctions, 
or any concentration of trip origins and destinations. Usually this siting is done based on intuitive 
local knowledge and space availability. The station area will typically consume more right-of-way than 
other parts of the BRT infrastructure. As such, station location may look for places where the right-of-way 
can be most easily widened; mid-block rather than at intersections where road space is at a premium; 
locations where small parcels of public land, variances in the road right-of-way, or the presence of 
low-cost land such as surface parking lots adjacent to the corridor.

Reducing the number of stations does not reduce variable dwell time, as in most cases the vast majority 
of boarding and alighting delay will just redistribute to other stations if a station is eliminated.

\subsection{ Implementing Limited-Stop Services}

As discussed in the previous subsection, every station adds delay to customers on board, a BRT vehicle 
usually needs from 12 to 30 seconds of dead time per station, and an average can be readily calculated 
for a specific corridor by observation. The idea of introducing limited and express services into a BRT 
system is to reduce this fixed dwell time. 

The introduction of a new, limited-stop service usually implies reducing frequencies on the local service. 
While the new limited-stop service will travel at a higher speed, the demand on the corridor is now divided 
between the local route or routes and the new limited route. The frequency of the original route therefore 
goes down, and the drop in frequency introduces some additional delay to local route customers making 
trips not served by the express route, as they have to wait longer for their vehicle to arrive.

Generally, routes should have a frequency of at least 10 vehicles per hour. If adding a limited route 
drops the frequency of the local service below 10 vehicles per hour, the chances are that the longer 
waiting time faced by the customers who cannot take the limited as an alternative will outweigh the time 
savings for those who can take the limited. There are, of course, exceptions.

This reduced frequency may also have an extra benefit in some cases because too high service frequencies 
commonly lead to service irregularity. Consider, for example, a vehicle that is a minute behind schedule 
in a service with 5-minute headways (12 vehicles per hour) service: when it arrives at the station the 
number of customers waiting to board is 20 percent larger than expected by the schedule, so it will need 
a bit more time for boarding and will be a bit more delayed. The next vehicle arriving at the same station 
(also on the schedule) will have 20 percent fewer boarding customers and will leave a bit sooner. The 
vehicle in front will increase the number of alighting customers per station as well. As the two vehicles 
continue down the route, the vehicle in front will fall farther and farther behind until the two vehicles 
are running together. If frequency is higher than 30 vehicles an hour (2-minute headway), the chances 
that one vehicle will arrive at its destination crowded and late, and the vehicle directly behind it 
will arrive nearly empty rises sharply. This irregularity leads to vehicle queue delays at stations (see 
Eq. 6.22). 

Therefore, if there are more than 30 vehicles an hour, there will be time savings from splitting the 
demand into more than one service, a local and a limited-stop service, just as a way of reducing the 
station queueing delay associated with this irregularity. Empirical evidence indicates that 22 vehicles 
an hour is optimal from the perspective of improving service regularity.

As a baseline, then, routes with frequencies of 20 or more per hour are candidates for the introduction 
of limited-stop services. If it is assumed that a standard 12-meter vehicle is at a reasonable design 
capacity at 60 customers per vehicle, 20 vehicles per hour translates roughly into a maximum load of 
1,200 customers per hour. Limited-stop services can therefore be considered for services that have maximum 
load above 1,200 customers per hour, as follows:

\number *At loads of 1,200–1,800:* It may make sense to introduce a service that only stops at the more 
popular stops when most boarding and alighting demand is concentrated at only a few stops along the corridor, 
but where the simple elimination of the stop is difficult for political reasons. 
\number *At loads greater than 1,800*: If demand is relatively evenly distributed along a corridor, it is 
desirable to split this demand up into more specialized services, as it will not add much waiting time 
(due to high frequencies related to the demand), and will increase speed for many customers, while also 
improving comfort and regularity of service. 
\number If trip lengths are long, or the renovation rate is low, these may indicate the need for limited-stop 
or express services. 

Beyond these basic principles, more detailed analysis should be done to determine whether limited-stop 
services are needed and where they should stop. To make a more detailed determination, something needs 
to be known of the trip origins and destinations of the customers using each bus route. Normally this 
is done by gathering enough information to put a corridor-specific OD matrix into a simulation model, 
and then running alternative scenarios to see how they perform. The following sections provide some basic 
guidance as to the sorts of local and limited-stop service patterns that one might test and why. Once 
he demand patterns of the alternaive services are output from the model, the following provides some 
tools to make a determination on the best pattern using cost-benefit analysis.

\subsubsection{The Costs of Implementing Limited-Stop Services}

The primary downside of implementing a limited-stop service is that it divides the ridership between 
the two services, cutting the frequency of the original local service, and hence increasing waiting times 
for the local service. Therefore, in order to determine whether it makes sense to add a limited-stop 
service, one must begin by calculating the total cost associated with waiting for a bus on a local route, 
as this will be the main cost of adding a limited route. In the sections that follow, the benefits will 
be calculated.

The cost of implementing an express route results in:

Eq. 6.50

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = \text{WaitCost}_\text{express} + \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} - \text{WaitCost}_\text{original service} $$

Where:

\item $$ \text{ExpressCost} $$: Additional cost of waiting during the peak hour with express service implementation; 
\item $$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{original service} $$:Total waiting cost of the original service;
\item $$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{express} $$: Total waiting cost of the included express service;
\item $$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} $$: Total waiting cost of the new local service.

The cost of waiting for a route (original, new express, or new local) service (WaitCostrouteexpress) 
is calculated using the previously explained formula from Section 6.4.3 Equation 6.12: 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} =  \text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+ Irr_\text{route}) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

Where:
\item $$\text{WaitCostRoute}$$: Total waiting time cost generated to the route users (in $);
\item $$\text{Ren}_\text{route}$$: Renovation factor of the route;
\item $$ \text{Costwait}$$: Average user waiting cost ($/time);
\item $$ \text{Irr}\text{route}$$: Irregularity index of the route; measure of the variance between the actual headways and 
the scheduled headways (usually near 0.3, see Section 6.3.9);
\item $$ \text{V}_\text{Size}$$: Vehicle capacity;
\item $$ \text{LoadFactor}$$: Design load factor (usually 0.85).

Note that frequency itself does not factor into this equation as the cost of waiting does not change 
based on how long customers must wait. The more demand, the greater number of people waiting, but the 
higher the frequency, the shorter wait per person; as a result, the total cost of the wait is the same 
either way. For low demand, each person faces a longer wait but the wait affects fewer people, so in 
the end, total demand is not related to total waiting cost.

If a BRT service is unlikely to have a functional operational control system, or if a regular bus service 
cannot easily be measured, it is often sufficient to simply use a standard operational irregularity index, 
which is usually around 0.3 based on empirical observation, or: 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} =  \text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+0.3) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

However, the level of irregularity usually varies with the frequency, and that will have a significant 
impact on irregularity. In order to evaluate irregularity varying with frequency (Freqroute), the formula 
needs to be modified to the following: 

Eq. 6.51

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} =  \text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+ ({\text{Freq}_\text{route}  \over \text{Freq}_\text{optimum}  }) ^2) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

Where:
\item $$\text{WaitCostRoute}$$: Total waiting time cost generated to the route users (in $);
\item $$\text{Ren}_\text{route}$$: Renovation factor of the route;
\item $$ \text{Costwait}$$: Average user waiting cost ($/time);
\item $$ \text{Irr}\text{route}$$: Irregularity index of the route; measure of the variance between the actual headways and 
the scheduled headways (usually near 0.3, see Section 6.3.9);
\item $$ \text{Freq}_{route}$$: Frequency of the route (vehicles/time)
\item $$ \text{V}_\text{Size}$$: Vehicle capacity;
\item $$ \text{LoadFactor}$$: Design load factor (usually 0.85);
\item $$ \text{Freq}_{optimum}$$: Optimum frequency to avoid irregularity of boarding and alighting;

Therefore, the formula can simply be rewritten as: 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} =  \text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+ ({\text{Freq}_\text{route}  \over 22 }) ^2) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

For example, if a route is split in two, one local and the other limited, and if half of the original 
frequency is assigned to each new route, the results for each route become: 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{express} = \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} $$
$$  = Re_\text{original service} *\text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+ ({\text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

If we call $$ K = Ren_\text{original service}*\text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * \text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$
, Eq. 6.42 can be rewritten as:

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = \text{WaitCost}_\text{express} + \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} - \text{WaitCost}_\text{originalservice} $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = 2 * \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} - \text{WaitCost}_\text{originalservice} $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = 2 * K *(1+ ({0.5 * \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) - K * (1+ ({0.5 * \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} =  K *(2+2*({0.5 * \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2 - 1 -  ({\text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} =  K *(1+2*0.25*({ \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2 - ({\text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} =  K *(1+0.5*({ \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2 - ({\text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2) $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} =  K *(1-0.5*({ \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2 ) ^2) $$


The express cost multiplier $$ (1-0.5*({ \text{Freq}_\text{original service}  \over 22 }) ^2 ) ^2) $$
is shown on the graph in Figure 6.60 as is K shown in function of $$ {\text{Freq}_\text{original service} \over 22} (22 = \text{Freq}_\text{optimum}) $$:

\figure[medium]{assets/image82.jpeg}{The cost factor of splitting a route into a local route and a new limited-stop 
route when the relation of frequency to optimal frequency ($$Fr \over Fot$$) is considered: When the frequency 
rises above 31 ($$ 31 \over 22 = 1.4 $$) the benefit from reduced service irregularity is greater than the time lost 
waiting for a lower frequency service.}{ Arthur Szász.}

In the graph on Figure 6.60, the “1” on the x axis represents 22 buses per hour ($$22 \over 22$$). The 1.4 represents 
roughly 31 buses per hour ($$31 \over 22 = 1.4$$). At greater than 31 buses per hour, the additional waiting caused 
by the reduced frequency from the splitting of the original route for the creation of a new express service 
is outweighed by the benefit of reducing the irregularity in bus arrivals to the point where CostWait 
always becomes a negative cost, or in other words, a benefit. Therefore, if a BRT route has more than 
thirty-one vehicles an hour, it generally makes sense to split it into a new limited-stop service just 
to reduce irregularity, even if boarding and alighting volumes are nearly uniform between stops.

If multiple ($$n$$) routes are created, then the total wait cost for each new route needs to be calculated:

Eq. 6.52

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = \text{WaitCost}_\text{express(1)} + \ldots +  \text{WaitCost}_\text{express(n)} +  \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} - \text{WaitCost}_\text{original service}$$


Where:

$$ \text{ExpressCost} $$: Additional cost of implementing limited-stop services;

$$ WaitCost_\text{express(1)} $$: Total waiting cost of the first added express service;

$$ WaitCost_\text{express(n)} $$: Total waiting cost of n-th additional added express service;

$$ WaitCost_\text{local} $$: Total waiting cost of adding one local service;

$$ WaitCost_\text{original service}$$: Total waiting cost of the original service.

\subsubsection{Benefits of Implementing Limited-Stop Services }

The main advantage of removing stations from a given service is that these vehicles will travel faster. 
For the most part, the total ridership on the route will simply be divided between the original service 
and the new limited-stop service, so there will be no significant impact on overall boarding (Tb) and 
alighting (Ta) time.  

*Hence, the benefit is a function of the reduction of fixed dwell time ($$T_0$$) for each station removed.*

The value of this benefit comes from two things: 

\item *A* The reduction in the travel time for all the customers that are using the limited-stop route ($$\text{Load}_\text{limited-stop at k}$$)
on each link where a station k is skipped. This should be multiplied by the value of customers’ time 
($$C_\text{travel}$$), which is usually treated as half their cost of waiting, or $$ C_\text{travel} = Cw/2$$. In the above examples, 
a constant value of waiting of US$12 per hour has been used so that in the examples in this section 
a constant value of travel time will be $6 per hour. It is usually set at one-third of the average wage. 

\item *B* The reduction in the travel time for the BRT vehicles, which would need less time to deliver the 
same service. The value of the operational cost reduction per bus resulting from the faster bus speeds 
is equal to the bus operational cost per hour ($$\text{Cost}_\text{bus}$$) multiplied by the number of buses that benefit 
from the stop reduction ($$F_\text{limited-stop-at-k}$$). 

So the benefit of creating a limited-stop service is expressed as follows:

Eq. 6.53

$$ ExpressBenefit=T_0* \sum_{k=\text{k=skipped station}} \text{Load}_\text{limited-stop-at-k}*\text{Cost}_\text{travel}+\text{Freq}_\text{limited-stop-at-k}*\text{Cost}_\text{bus} $$
Where:

\item $$ \text{ExpressBenefit} $$: Benefit of implementing limited-stop services;
\item $$ T_0$$: Fixed dwell time (or “dead time”);
\item $$ \text{Load}_\text{limited stop at k}$$: Passenger load that uses the new limited-stop route on each link where a station 
k is skipped;
\item $$ \text{Cost}_\text{travel}$$: Passenger value of time when travelling;
\item $$ \text{Freq}_\text{limited-stop-at-k}$$: Number of buses that benefit from the removal of station, k; 
\item $$ \text{Cost}_\text{bus}$$: Bus operational cost per hour (see Section 6.3.12).

An express route should be created when there is a net benefit, or when $$\text{Benefit}_\text{express} $$ is greater than 
the total waiting cost of adding that route, as calculated in the previous subsection item.

Eq. 6.54 

$$ \text{ExpressBenefit}>\text{ExpressCost} $$

Where:
\item $$ \text{ExpressBenefit}: $$ Benefit of implementing limited-stop services;
\item $$ \text{ExpressCost}: $$ Total waiting cost of adding route.

For more complex scenarios, the total benefits of each route added need to be weighed against the total 
costs of each route added.  

\subsubsection{Examples of Typical Service Patterns}

In the examples that follow, the standard data set in Table 6.31 will not vary by scenario. This data 
can easily be collected for a planned BRT corridor. 

It is assumed that it has already been decided that the optimum number of BRT stations is twenty-five, 
based on the formula provided in Section 6.7.1, showing an optimal distance between stations. We also 
assume that the vehicle design capacity has already been decided as a 150-passenger (i.e., VSize \* LoadFactor) 
articulated bus due to the high demand. Then, based on the BRT design and vehicle type, each station 
is assumed to have a fixed dwell time of thirty seconds, based on data collected from bus operators. 
The operational cost of this vehicle is US$105 per hour (this is the total bus operating costs needed 
for the calculation, rather than just the fixed costs). Based on the prevailing wage rate and willingness-to-pay 
studies, the cost of travel time is US$6 per hour, and waiting is US$12 per hour.

\subsection{Limited-Stop Services When Demand Is Uniform }

Some BRT services have fairly uniform demand, with customers getting on and off a route in more or 
less even numbers consistently throughout the corridor. Limited-stop services are the least likely to 
be attractive in the context of homogenous demand, but they are still sometimes attractive, particularly 
if there is a lot of irregularity resulting from high frequencies. In many instances, limited-stop services 
are attractive only during peak periods.

When demand is uniform, certain patterns of limited-stop service prove to be mathematically optimal—namely 
those that skip a cluster of stations.  

In this example, it is assumed that there is a one-way local bus route, and demand is shaped in a perfect 
curve throughout the route, as per Table 6.32. In other words, it is assumed that each of the twenty-five 
station stops is a trip origin (O) and a trip destination (D) in a local origin-destination matrix, and 
that fifty-eight customers are travelling between each zone.

In a real-world situation, this data should have already been collected and put into a spreadsheet. 
Most demand modeling software can estimate the OD matrix from boarding and alighting counts, but it is 
better to have real station-to-station OD data.

\begintable{Uniform Origin-Destination (OD) Matrix Example}
    \useimage{assets/image83.png}
\endtable

The OD matrix of Table 6.32 would result in the boarding and alighting 
per station and loads after leaving the station as shown on Table 6.33 and Figure 6.61 where the dots 
near the x axis show the number of customers boarding (blue) and alighting (red) at each station; the 
green line indicates the load at each station.

Note that other OD patterns could yield the boarding and alighting results observed in the table, and 
a different OD matrix will require another optimal service pattern; that is why it is best to have the 
real OD matrix for the whole operating time or day. 

\begintable[small]{Boarding, Alighting, and Loads per Station}

The maximum hourly load on the critical link is 9,048 (MaxLoad). It occurs between the twelfth and 
thirteenth stations. As the design bus capacity (VSize \* LoadFactor) is 150, the frequency (F) should 
be set at around 61 per hour, or

$$ F = {9048 \over 150} = 61.32 $$

The determination to be made is whether there would be benefits in splitting this demand into a limited-stop 
service and a local service, and if so, which stations should be skipped by the limited-stop service. 
There are multiple service patterns that might be tested, but certain standard approaches tend to optimize 
results. In the case of homogenous demand, a limited-stop service that bypasses the middle stations in 
the corridor, where the relation of loads to boarding and alighting are higher, proves mathematically 
to always be superior to other stopping patterns such as skipping stations or clusters of stations at 
the beginning, middle, and end of a route. As such, no other alternatives are tested under homogenous 
demand. 

\figure{assets/image86.jpeg}{Stop sequence for an express service with uniform demand profile (fifty-eight 
customers between each stop) where both the local and the express stop at all Zone “A” stations and Zone 
“C” stations but where the express does not stop in Zone “B” stations. Image}{ Pedro Szász.}

When demand is relatively uniform in a manner similar to this example, it often makes sense to have 
a limited service run local at the beginning and at the end of its route, and run express in the middle 
of the route. Figure 6.62 demonstrates this by dividing the route into three zones—A, B, and C. In this 
case, the limited skips all seven stations in the middle Zone B (stations ten to seventeen).

For a limited service to yield benefits, a sufficient number of customers need to gain enough time 
from the removal of stations to make up for the loss of frequency that results from splitting the route. 
To make it worthwhile for customers, the service needs to pass at least a cluster of stations where the 
total fixed dwell time saved is greater than the new waiting time imposed by the loss of frequency.

From looking at the curve, it may appear that the limited-stop service bypasses the majority of the 
demand, but keep in mind that the curve says that the majority of the demand is actually *on the bus 
* in the middle of the corridor and that boardings and alightings combined are uniform throughout.

Based on the proposed split of the service in two:
\item Customers travelling between points within Zone A or between points within Zone C will be indifferent 
to the two services, and will just take whichever vehicle comes first; there is no cost and no benefit 
derived from the creation of the new service for those customers;
\item Customers travelling between Zone A and Zone B, or between Zone B and Zone C will have to take 
the local bus, and they will perceive time losses due to the lower frequency on the local service;
\item While customers travelling between Zone A and Zone C could take either service, all would take 
the limited-stop service because, in this example, the time saved from skipping the intermediate stops 
is greater than the time lost due to waiting for another vehicle. Those who cannot figure out how to 
read the service maps or confused tourists might be exceptions. 

Those taking the limited-stop service gain significant time savings through bypassing stops in Section 
B from their route.

\begintable[small]{Demand Division by Zone}
    \useimage{assets/table-6.34.jpg}
\endtable

\' \begintable{Demand Division by Zone}

In Table 6.34, the areas highlighted in yellow are trips within Zone A and within Zone C that will 
be split evenly between the local and express service. The area in pink will be served entirely by the 
local service, and the area in blue will be served entirely by the express service.

\begintable{Origin Destination Matrix for Uniform Demand on a Bus Route}
    \useimage{assets/image87.png}
\endtable

Given 
the demand profile presented here, the load for each service would divide as shown in Figure 6.63.

\figure{assets/image88.jpeg}{Service Load divided between the local and the limited service in a uniform 
demand example scenario. Image}{ Pedro Szász.}

If this division of the demand is assigned on a station-by-station basis to each service, the boarding 
and alighting numbers for the limited route are given in Table 6.35. The difference between the boarding 
and alighting numbers on the limited-stop service and on the original route would be the boarding and 
alighting remaining on the local service (not shown).

\begintable[small]{Example Division of Customers between Limited-Stop and Local Services}
    \useimage{assets/image89.png}
\endtable

In this case, the benefit is quite simple to estimate, by formula (Equation 
6.53):

$$ ExpressBenefit=T_0* \sum_{k=\text{skiped station}} \text{Load}_\text{limited-stop-at-k}*\text{Cost}_\text{travel}+\text{Freq}_\text{limited-stop-at-k}*\text{Cost}_\text{bus} $$

Sum for all stations “k” where the limited does not stop.

The $$ \text{Load}_\text{limited stop at k} $$ is the number of customers on board the express bus that are passing any 
station “k” that is jumped by the limited-stop service. In this example, all trips from Zone A to Zone 
C, which is the area shaded in blue on Table 6.35, or demand from stations (one to nine) to stations 
(seventeen to twenty-five):

$$ \sum_{k= \text{skipped station}} \text{Load}_\text{limited-stop-at-k} = 9 * 9 * 58 = 4698 \text{pass/h} $$

This is because there are nine by nine zones where there are only express customers and each interzonal 
demand is 58, so 4,698 customers. 

The frequency of the limited and the local route will vary depending on the demand the limited route 
captures. In this case, 

$$ F_\text{express} = {4698 \over 150} = 31.32\text{bus/hour} $$

$$ F_\text{local} = {4350 \over 150} = 28.68\text{bus/hour} $$

Therefore

$$ ExpressBenefit= 30 / 3600 * 7 * (4698 * 6 + 31.32 *105 ) = 1826\text{US\$/hour} $$ 

Where $$ 30 / 3600 * 7 = 30 $$ seconds of fixed dwell time per stop removed/3600 seconds in an hour times 7 stops 
removed; 4,698 is the number of customers; 6 is their value of an hour; 31.32 is the frequency; and 105 
is the operating cost per bus per hour. 

Recalling that the cost of adding the limited-stop service will be as follows (Equation 6.52): 


$$ \text{ExpressCost} = \text{WaitCost}_\text{express(1)} + \ldots +  \text{WaitCost}_\text{express(n)} +  \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} - \text{WaitCost}_\text{original service}$$

And that (Equation 6.51):  

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{route} =  \text{Ren}_\text{route} * \text{Cost}_\text{wait} * 0.5 * (1+ ({\text{Freq}_\text{route}  \over \text{Freq}_\text{optimum}  }) ^2) *\text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} $$

Given the data set for all examples:

\item $$ \text{LoadFactor} * \text{VSize} = 150 $$  
\item $$ \text{Ren} = 1.46 $$
\item $$ \text{Cost}_\text{wait} = 12 $$
\item $$ \text{Freq}_\text{originalservice} = 60 $$
\item $$ \text{Freq}_\text{local} = 28.68 $$
\item $$ \text{Freq}_\text{express} = 31.32 $$

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{original service}=0.5*1.461*150*12*(1+(0.5* 60/22)^2 = 3760 $$ 

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{local} = 0.5 * 1.461 * 150 *12 * 1+ (0.5*31.32/22)^2 = 1874 $$

$$ \text{WaitCost}_\text{express} =  0.5 * 1.461 * 150 * 12 * 1 + ( 0.5*31.32/22)^2=1981 $$

$$ \text{ExpressCost} = 1981 + 1874 - 3760 =  95 \text{US\$/hour} $$


So, in this case, $$ \text{ExpressBenefit} = 1826 \text{US\$/hour} $$  and $$ C_{w \text{total}} = 95 \text{US\$/hour}$$. In this case, the waiting 
cost associated with adding another service is very low, because the original service was so frequent 
that there was a lot of needless waiting due to the irregularity of service, and much of this delay is 
mitigated by the reduction in frequencies. (Note that the effect of irregularity reduction is a bit exaggerated 
here, as the portion of users that can take both services will contribute to irregularity of both services 
in Zones A and C as if it was only one service with a frequency of sixty BRT vehicles per hour.)

Therefore, as $$ \text{ExpressBenefit} > \text{ExpressCost} $$ it can be said that adding a limited-stop service is a very 
good idea in this case. 

The optimal number of stations to be skipped on the proposed express service is the next determination 
to make. A rough calculation can be used as a basic guide. In short, the service should make sure that 
the time saved by the people able to skip stations is greater than the additional time added by the loss 
of frequency for the people that have to remain on the local service. For example, cutting the frequency 
from sixty to thirty-one buses per hour implies only an additional minute of waiting. While the average 
wait is half a minute, one minute is used because the actual average wait time is multiplied by two to 
factor in people’s perception of the wait time. Thus, the reduction in frequency adds about 1.3 minutes 
in new delay to customers, if a standard irregularity of 0.3 is used. 

With a fixed dwell time at the station stops at thirty seconds, at least three or four stations need 
to be removed to attract any customers, and probably more. If too many stations are taken away, there 
will not be enough customers on the new limited to justify a high-frequency limited service, so the range 
of stations to be removed shall be limited as well.

The following method provides a way of testing whether more or fewer stations should be removed. In 
essence, the same process run for the specific scenario (seven stations removed) needs to be tested for 
all other reasonable alternatives.

\begintable{Total Benefits with Varying Numbers of Stops Removed from the Example}
    \useimage{assets/image90.png}
\endtable

In Table 6.37, the first three columns represent the stopping pattern of 
various alternative limited services (divided into Segments A, B, and C). The first row represents a 
scenario where the first eleven stations are both local and limited, the next three stations are local 
only, and the last eleven stations are both local and limited. The second row represents a scenario in 
which the first ten stations are shared, then the express service skips five stations, then the last 
ten stations are again shared, and so on.

The second set of columns (four columns) shows the division of customers between the limited only, 
the local only, and the customers shared by the two services based on the previously stated assumptions. 
It is broken out in this way because only the riders interested in taking the express service (going 
from Zone A to Zone C) enjoy benefits from the removal of stations. The remainder of the limited bus 
customers (those who take the express and use it as a local within Zone A and Zone C) do not benefit 
from the removal of stations.

In the third row of the table the initial example is tested. An express service is implemented with 
seven stops skipped and there are 4,698 customers who benefit from the removal of stations, or those 
customers moving between Zone A and Zone C.

In addition to showing the required frequency for the limited-stop service, the table also includes 
calculations of time savings per bus, which is equal to the number of stations skipped by the limited 
service in Zone B, multiplied by thirty seconds of fixed dwell time saved per station. So for the first 
row, Zone B stations are equal to three in scenario I, so 1.5 minutes are saved per bus; if five stations 
are removed, 2.5 minutes are saved per bus, and so forth.  

The next column shows the number of customer hours of benefit from the express service. It multiplies 
the number of express customers that bypass the seven stations (total load of customers passing stations 
in Zone B) by the savings per bus. 

The next column shows the benefits in terms of bus travel time, so it multiplies the frequency of the 
limited-stop service (46.8 for the first row) by the time savings per bus (1.5 minutes for the first 
row), then divides the total by 60 to give an hour figure (yields 1.17 hours of bus operating time saved 
in the scenario of the first row).  

Finally, times saved for customers and vehicles are respectively multiplied by the value of time (in 
the first row: customers’ 175.45 hours saved multiplied by US$6/hour results in US$1,053 and operating 
cost per bus of US$105/hour times saved 1.17 hours save results in US$123, so the total benefit of 
the express service \[for 3 stops removed\] is US$1,176).

These benefits then need to be compared to the net cost of replacing the original service with two 
new services, one local and one express, as is shown on Table 6.38. These net costs can be deducted from 
the benefit to indicate total net benefits (last column).

\begintable{Benefits Net of Costs for Varying Numbers of Eliminated Stops}
    \useimage{assets/table-6.38.jpg}
\endtable

These net benefits are then calculated for all situations proposed, following 
the method of the original scenario used in this example. The result turns out to favor the initially 
tested situation: skipping seven stations. The net benefit of skipping seven stations—US$1,741—exceeds 
the net benefit of every other scenario.

The following table shows the degree of sensitivity of the total benefit to total demand. In Table 
6.39, the same attributes are assigned, except the demand is cut by 40 percent across the board. In that 
situation, instead of the frequency dropping from 60 to 30, with a considerable improvement of irregularity 
(with 22 being optimal) it drops from 30 to 15 and the irregularity benefit is smaller. Once the time 
penalty for adding the service is relatively greater and the number of beneficiaries of the new limited 
service is relatively lower, skipping nine stations becomes slightly more beneficial than skipping seven 
stations. Hence, in uniform demand, the benefits of the limited service are highly sensitive to demand 
levels.

\begintable{Net Benefits of Costs with Varying Numbers of Eliminated Stops under Lower Demand Scenario}
    \useimage{assets/table-6.38.jpg}
\endtable

\subsubsection{Demand Patterns Typical of Trunk-and-Feeder Systems}

In some systems, such as a trunk-and-feeder system, it is likely that demand will be concentrated at 
the beginning and/or end of the BRT trunk corridor—for instance, at the transfer station on one end and 
the downtown on the other. Demand will tend to concentrate in this way because the feeder routes on one 
end would tend to discharge large numbers of customers at the transfer terminal, and there would be a 
similar concentration of boardings and alightings at the central business district (CBD).

In this example, a total of 17,276 boardings and alightings are assumed, the same number as in the 
uniform demand example, but in this case, 50 percent of them occur at the first and last stations (25 
percent at each) instead of only 8.3 percent.

The boarding and alighting and OD matrix of the corridor, if all other stations have uniform demand, 
would look like Table 6.40 and, if only one service operated with this OD pattern, the load would look 
like the load diagram in Figure 6.64.

\begintable{Origin Destination Matrix for Demand Concentrated at Terminals}
    \useimage{assets/image93.png}
\endtable

\figure{assets/image94.jpeg}{Demand profile for a corridor where most demand is travelling between 
the two end terminals.}{ Pedro Szász.}

In this case, it is worth considering adding a service that runs directly between the first station 
(the transfer terminal) and the last terminal (downtown). If such a service were added, the ridership 
would split between the limited and local service as per Table 6.41. 

\begintable[small]{Loads on the Local and Limited}
    \useimage{assets/image95.png}
\endtable

On Table 6.42, the same stopping pattern is tested for their ridership 
and comparative costs and benefits, but in each one, an additional station is removed at the beginning 
and ending of the limited-stop service; the formulas and method from the previous example are used to 
calculate the net benefit.

\begintable{Costs and Benefits of Varying Stopping Patterns}
    \useimage{assets/image96.png}
\endtable

In this case, a limited-stop service that stops only at the first and last 
stations brings more benefits to customers. These benefits significantly outweigh the costs. With a maximum 
load on the critical link of the limited route at 4,327, and a related frequency of 29 trips per hour 
(4,327/150), the maximum load remaining on the local service of 6,568 passengers per hour yields a frequency 
of 44. This is still high enough to cause an elevated level of irregularity in the boarding and alighting 
process, so another express route might be added. Based on the previous example, this new service would 
skip the middle stations.

\subsection{Demand Concentrated at a Few Stops}

It is also common for demand to be concentrated at a few stops along a corridor because there are some 
large trip generators or attractors in those locations, like hospitals, schools, high-density housing 
developments, or shopping malls. Such a corridor might result in a boarding and alighting pattern like 
Figure 6.65.

\figure{assets/image97.png}{Demand profile for a corridor with demand heavily concentrated between 
a few important stops.}{ Pedro Szász.}

The trip origin and destination matrix would look something like that shown in Table 6.43, where the 
total number of trips is similar to the previous examples.

\begintable{Origin Destination Matrix Example for Clustered Demand on a Corridor}
    \useimage{assets/image98.png}
\endtable

Two options are tested to illustrate some general principles, correspondent 
boarding, alighting, and loads are shown in Table 6.44 where the stations highlighted in red would be 
both limited and local stops, while the stations in gray would be served only by the local service.
\item One limited-stop service that stops only at the high volume stations, \#1, \#7, \#13, \#19, and \#25. 
\item One limited-stop service that stops at \#1–7, then \#13, then \#19–25. 

\begintable{Boardings, Alightings, and Load Comparison between Varying Service Patterns for Clustered 
Demand Example}
    \useimage{assets/image99.png}
\endtable

The loads assumes that the time savings from the number of stations skipped 
is greater than the loss of time waiting for the next express bus for all possible express bus trips, 
so customers between the stations served by the express service (red cells) use that service.

\begintable{Loads Passing Stations and Benefits for Two Alternative Express Services under Clustered 
Demand Example}
    \useimage{assets/image100.png}
\endtable 

The loads aboard an express service passing the stations skipped for each 
alternative are listed under the column “Load (k)” in Table 6.45, and the value of the time savings associated 
with this benefit are calculated in the “Total” column.

\begintable[small]{Frequency and Operational Vehicle Benefits for Two Alternative Express Services under Clustered 
Demand Example}
    \useimage{assets/image101.png}
\endtable

In Table 6.46, the required frequency for the new express route is calculated 
from the maximum load on the express route divided by 150, the designed bus capacity. This is multiplied 
by the number of stations removed in each scenario and by the operational cost savings per hour to yield 
the total bus cost savings for each alternative.

Table 6.47 shows the (waiting) costs associated with the lower frequency to be subtracted from the 
benefits.

\begintable[small]{Costs of the Two Alternative Express Services under Clustered Demand Example}
    \useimage{assets/image102.png}
\endtable

In the second option of express service, the new express service captures 
a lot more demand, bringing the frequency of both the express and the local service into a more optimal 
range, significantly reducing the irregularity of service. The benefit from reduced irregularity is greater 
than the cost in waiting caused by the reduction in frequency, so in this case the “cost” is negative, 
or a “benefit.”

As a result, the net benefit of the alternative with express service attending a cluster of stations 
at the beginning and ending of the route, rather than only stopping at the high-demand stations, performs 
much better, as shown in Table 6.48.

\begintable[small]{Net Benefits of the Two Alternative Express Services under Clustered Demand Example}
    \useimage{assets/image103.png}
\endtable

At these high levels of demand, additional express routes can be tried 
following similarly clustered patterns focusing on higher demand clusters of stations, and their relative 
costs and benefits tested.

Several clusters of stopping stations should be tested, adding more types of services until the frequency 
of each route is near the optimal range of twenty-two. The diagram in Figure 6.66 is the original service 
concept that was developed for TransMilenio in Bogotá loosely based on these principles.

\figure{assets/image104.jpeg}{Diagram of original service concept for TransMilenio, based on the concept 
of clustering stations served by express services (each dot is a served station). It included three express 
services in order to place each service frequency in the range of optimal frequencies. Diagram}{ ITDP.}

\subsection{Demand Concentrated at One End of a Corridor}

There are occasions when there is a very high demand at the beginning of a route and this demand gradually 
diminishes throughout the route. This situation normally results in the afternoon peak, when there is 
a monocentric CBD, or when there is a large transfer terminal.

The demand in this case is always decreasing as in Figure 6.67, and the internal O/D matrix with total 
similar to the previous examples is shown in Table 6.48.

\begintable{Origin Destination Matrix Example for Declining Demand on a Bus Corridor}
    \useimage{assets/image105.png}
\endtable

This yields the following boarding, alighting, and load pattern on the original service. This example is taken 
from the real case of the Santo Amaro—Nove de Julho corridor, project implemented in 1986 in São Paulo.

\figure{assets/image106.jpeg}{Demand profile for a corridor with all trips boarding at a single terminal 
but alighting in even numbers at station stops along the corridor.}{ Pedro Szász.}

In this example there are 15,000 customers boarding at the first station, a transfer terminal, and 
just 2,395 customers boarding at the remaining 33 stations. In this situation, a service plan similar 
to the one shown in Figure 6.68 turns out to be optimal.

\figure{assets/image107.jpeg}{Optimal service pattern for a corridor with most demand boarding at a 
single terminal but alighting in even numbers at station stops along the corridor. Image}{ Arthur Szász.}

Each route serves a specific stretch of the corridor. The route goes express from the terminal (or 
CBD) to the beginning of the stretch it services, then it makes all the stops in its service area, and 
then returns (usually express) to the terminal. The return is express, because the demand in the opposite 
direction is generally much lower.

The big difference between this scenario and earlier scenarios is that, as the express routes do not 
reach the end of the corridor, there is a significant reduction in total cycle time (TC) and consequently 
a sizable fleet reduction. Each express service is designed to meet the direct demand from the terminal 
(or CBD) to a specific service zone.

\begintable{Boarding, Alighting, and Load per Designed Service on Declining Demand Example Corridor}
    \useimage{assets/image108.png}
\endtable

One local service can attend to all the trips not destined for the terminal 
(2,395 passengers per hour that board and alight along the corridor). This service has a maximum load 
of around 986 passengers per hour.

In this case, the benefits to passengers of the new services are as shown in Table 6.51 and the benefits 
to operations of the new services are as shown in Table 6.52.

\begintable[small]{Benefits of New Services to Passengers}
    \useimage{assets/image109.png}
\endtable

\begintable{Benefits of New Services to Operations}
    \useimage{assets/image110.png}
\endtable

In this case, because of the early return of some of the vehicles, there 
are savings in running time for vehicles, not only from the removal of stations. To include this benefit, 
the operational time savings for not running till the end of the corridor are also calculated.

Benefits add operational savings (US$3,538) and passenger savings (US$1,500) to the total of US$5,038.

\begintable[small]{Costs}
    \useimage{assets/image111.png}
\endtable

Following the formula for calculating the costs of implementing the new 
express routes (the net balance of wait cost per route), the additional cost is US$524, as summarized 
in Table 6.53. Resulting in a net benefit of (US$5,038–US$524) US$4,515. In this example, the fact 
that many services allowed early return led to a dramatic reduction in operating costs, as buses were 
able to reduce their cycle times.

\subsection{Shortened Routes}

Even within simple BRT systems that only allow for local stations, it is possible to adjust the service 
to better meet the demand by having some bus routes turn around before reaching the terminal. The same 
corridor can host several routes of varying lengths. A single corridor may be split into two or more 
routes covering a different portion of the corridor.  

\figure{assets/image112.png}{Adding a second local service that covers only the highest demand segment 
of a corridor can reduce operating costs while limiting additional delay for customers. Image}{ Pedro 
Szász.}

In Figure 6.69, a diagram shows the loads along an existing bus corridor. If the demand on a given 
part of the corridor is high, a second service can be added that operates only on that part of the route. 
All customers travelling between any OD pair on the shorter service will be indifferent to the two bus 
routes, so there is no lost travel time for any customer. There are, however, significant operational 
cost savings, as in the previous example, and the BRT vehicles operating on the shortened service avoid 
a large number of stations.  

Shortened routes focusing on higher-demand central areas will contribute to high operating efficiencies. 
These efficiency gains will help reduce the number of vehicles required to serve the corridor.  

Looking at Figure 6.69, where most of the corridor’s demand occurs in the central area, if there is 
only one service operating the entire length of the corridor, all vehicles would depart from point T 
and operate with low load factors at the beginning and the end of the corridor. However, if vehicles 
were to operate a shortened route beginning from point R, then the number of vehicles required to serve 
the corridor will be reduced and the load factor per bus will increase. This fleet reduction is calculated 
as:

Eq. 6.55

$$ \text{Fleet reduction} = {{2*|R-T| \over V_\text{corridor} } * A - B) \over \text{VSize} * \text{LoadFactor}} $$

Where:
\item $$ T $$: Terminal position;
\item $$ R $$: Early return position;
\item $$ V_\text{corridor} $$: Corridor commercial speed; 
\item $$ |R-T| $$: Distance between early return position and terminal;
\item $$ |R-T|/V_\text{corridor} $$:  Travel time between early return position and terminal;
\item $$ A $$: Maximum Demand on the Critical Link (MaxLoad);
\item $$ B $$: Load on point $.

Example:

$$ A = 15,000 \text{passengers/hour} $$;

$$ B = 10,000 \text{passengers/hour} $$;

$$ V = 25 \text{km/hour} $$;

$$ T = 0 $$;

$$ R = 5 \text{km}$$;

$$ {(R-T)/V} = 12\text{minutes(uni-directional time)} = (5/25) \text{hours} $$;

$$ \text{VSize} * \text{LoadFactor} = 150 pax/bus (vehicle capacity) $$.

$$ \text{Fleet reduction}= {2* {|5-0| /over 25} * 15,000 – 10,000 \over 150 } =6 \text{vehicles} $$

In this case, as might be typical of a downtown, most of the demand may be headed downtown from two 
different directions. For instance, in Yichang, China, along the new BRT corridor, bus routes previously 
operated all the way through the CBD from north to south and south to north.  

In this situation, the vehicles frequently run with low occupancy on either end. Severing one long 
route in the middle of the city center would force a transfer on a large number of customers with destinations 
on the far side of the city center. However, having each route pass through to the far edge of the CBD, 
overlapping through the highest demand section of the city, avoids the transfer and also allows for a 
higher frequency of service for all customers operating in the zone where the routes from both sides 
overlap.  

\figure{assets/image113.jpeg}{Yichang overlapping services can be maintained only in the CBD doubling frequency in 
the high demand part of the corridor, while limiting total route length to minimize irregularity.}{ ITDP.}  

\figure{assets/image114.jpeg}{The need for transfers is also reduced when local routes are overlapping in the CBD,
zoom of proposed design in Yichang CBD.}{ ITDP.}  


The specific costs and benefits of these general approaches should be tested with the actual OD matrix 
for each corridor. 

These early turn-around services can significantly improve the system’s financial performance, but 
they must be linked with clear customer information about which vehicle is approaching the station and 
its destination. Otherwise, customers can become confused and frustrated.  

In general, the shortened routes are not terminated at the station with the highest boarding and alighting 
volumes in the system. These stations are already stressed by the quantity of customers and the intensity 
of customer movements. Further, since these stations tend to be located in the densest portion of the 
urban area, there are fewer opportunities to efficiently turn the vehicles around. Normally these shortened 
services terminate just beyond such high-volume stations.  

This type of service programming will typically reduce overall operational costs by as much as 10 percent. 
In order to accommodate a shortened route option, the planning process should provide sufficient flexibility 
with regard to:
\item Providing places where vehicles can make U-turns within the BRT system;
\item Designing the station areas with sufficient extra capacity to allow for service adjustments.
