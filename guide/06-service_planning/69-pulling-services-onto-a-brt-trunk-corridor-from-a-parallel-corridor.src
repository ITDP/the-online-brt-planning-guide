If the BRT trunk corridor is not saturated after adding all the existing routes onto the corridor by 
the BRT service plan, it may be advantageous to take a bus route that currently does not use the BRT 
corridor, and pull it onto the BRT corridor. The result will likely be a travel time savings for some 
customers, as their trip will be sped up on the BRT portion of the route. However, it could also mean 
a travel time loss for other customers, if the rerouting results in a longer trip for them or longer 
walks. These costs and benefits need to be weighed in order to make the decision. 

\figure{assets/image120.png}{Three options for planning routes near a BRT corridor. Image}{ ITDP.}

Above are three simplified scenarios that show the basic options for handling an existing route that 
travels *near *the BRT corridor.
\item Option I represents the way bus routes are currently configured—the green line is the BRT corridor 
with a BRT route on top of it, and the blue line is an existing bus route that travels near the BRT corridor 
and ends in the same place;
\item Option II represents a decision to “route on” the blue service to use the BRT infrastructure, 
but retain it as a “direct service”;
\item Option III represents a route that has been “routed on” to a BRT corridor, but split into a trunk 
feeder service. 

If there is sufficient demand to justify it, a fourth option would be to retain the current route and 
add a new route that uses the BRT trunk corridor for part of the route. Option I is preferable when pulling 
a bus service onto a new, faster BRT corridor introduces more delay due to the indirectness of the route 
than it saves due to the superior BRT infrastructure. Option II is preferred when the travel-time savings 
of pulling the route onto the BRT corridor for part of its journey saves more time and serves as many 
customers as the current route operating in mixed traffic conditions. Option II introduces some indirectness 
of route but avoids any transfer penalty. Option III would be preferred mainly when there are significant 
time savings benefits to rerouting onto the BRT trunk corridor, yet the addition of a fully direct service 
in the optimal vehicle size for that service would saturate the BRT corridor, slowing down the speeds 
for the busway. The indirectness of route and transfer penalty would need to be compensated by both the 
higher speeds of using the BRT trunk corridor and the higher frequencies in the new feeder route.

In some cases, it is best to create a hybrid of Options I and II, where the blue route is routed onto 
the BRT corridor, while the original blue route service is retained. Frequency would need to be split 
between the two, and this would allow customers who benefit more from one or the other scenario to have 
the option of which route to take. Many of the issues described in the limited-services section apply 
here since you are again splitting frequencies. However, this might also be a more politically feasible 
solution—even when there are greater benefits to routing a service onto the BRT corridor—because it can 
often be politically challenging to eliminate a route altogether.
