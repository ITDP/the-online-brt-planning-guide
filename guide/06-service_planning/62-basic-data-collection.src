> It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins
to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
@ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, writer and physician, 1859–1930

In order to propose an optimal service plan, its costs and benefits must be known, and understanding 
customers’ needs is essential for achieving that. The current state of the public transport system may 
not exactly show all user demands, but it will certainly point in that direction more reliably than alternatives; 
it is composed of very objective and comprehensive information, which is cheap to collect in comparison 
with alternatives and overall project costs.

While existing public transport operations are sometimes poorly aligned with public transport customer 
needs for a variety of reasons, in most cities economic forces tend to push public transport services 
close to consumer needs. In addition, customers are used to the services as they currently exist—and 
resist change. Service plans should be developed conservatively, moving away from existing services only 
when compelling data indicates that a change would improve services. 

Ideally, the data collected should be enough to understand all existing services, the demand throughout 
the day, and the full trip origin and destination for every public transport customer in the corridor 
influence area, or at least the time and location of where customers entered the existing public transport 
system and where they exited.  

Normally, this does not require having all the data about every trip, but rather having a sample of 
data large enough to infer the behavior of the whole. Even where all disaggregated trip data is available, 
as well as a computer program able to process it trip by trip (to date, no current demand modeling software 
has such capabilities), a systematic aggregation is still necessary so that the results can be analyzed 
by humans.

The common way of doing this is to provide customer demand information aggregated per hour of the day 
in a visual format. It is always best to have data for both peak and off-peak periods. For the analysis 
in this chapter, much of the services and engineering will be designed around the peak hour, so an estimated 
peak hour demand is needed. If the frequency is very low, it may be necessary to aggregate by peak period, 
as in morning peak, midday off peak, afternoon peak, and so forth, and then infer the average peak hour 
demand from the peak period, in order to avoid data distortions. For instance, in the United States, 
a bus route might have only three trips between seven and eight, and only two between eight and nine, 
because one of the trips falls at 7:59 and one falls at 9:01, creating a false impression that demand 
is far more irregular than it is. In general, however, the data needs to be put in a “peak” hour format, 
as this is used to make key engineering decisions. Business planning decisions must also be informed 
by the relationship between the peak hour and the off-peak periods, as this relationship can make (or 
break) the financial sustainability of the project. 

For service planning, the following data is needed: 
\item The itinerary of every route, 
\item The number of departures per hour;
\item The average travel time between stops;
\item The number of customers boarding and alighting at each stop;
\item The number of customers transferred from each route to every other route.

Initially, it is only relevant that this data is processed for typical days, but when the project moves 
forward, service plans for Saturdays and Sundays and seasonal variations (school holidays) will be required 
for a complete evaluation. Additional trip data, as described below, may already have been collected 
using the methods described in Chapter 4: Demand Analysis, and repeated here, focusing on the processing 
needs for the service plan design.

\subsection{ Itineraries and Average Travel Time between Stops}

For the process of corridor selection, all of the existing public transport routes using the planned 
BRT corridor should have been mapped into a GIS program (or a GIS interface of a demand modeling tool 
like TransCAD or Emme). 

If this information is not already available, or badly coded, it will be necessary to have surveyors 
ride each bus with a GPS and record the coordinates of each bus stop and each bus route. This is not 
expensive or difficult. Even if this data has already been collected by someone else, it may be out of 
date, so it is a good idea to check the data by randomly sampling the key routes with a GPS to make sure 
it is accurate. Many software applications (apps) for smartphones can collect this data.

Average speeds from bus stop to bus stop should be surveyed during the peak hour and off-peak period. 
For a given distance, a graphic such as the one below can be generated to represent the speed over the 
course of a day. Data needs to be collected over multiple days to generate a reliable average speed.

MD 355. The red line represents observed actual bus times, the green line represents scheduled bus times, 
and the blue line represents the travel time of a car moving on the same route as the bus.}{ Arthur 
Szász.}

In a growing number of cities, the bus routes have already been input into an open standard format 
like General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) that allows people to manipulate the data in multiple 
applications. Usually this data is used for customer information dissemination (its name was originally 
Google Transit Feed Specification), but these same data sets can be used for service planning. GTFS data 
may be good enough to give coordinates for mapping the existing public transport system, or it may have 
a lot of inaccuracies that need to be cleaned up. The route needs to be mapped in both directions, as 
buses may not take the same route going in different directions and bus stops have different positions. 


\subsection{ Number of Customers Boarding and Alighting at Each Stop}

The number of existing bus or minibus customers that are currently boarding and alighting on all of 
the bus routes that use the BRT corridor at each station needs to be collected and mapped. This is usually 
done by a survey team. Typically, along the planned BRT trunk corridor, if the stations are clearly marked 
and used, the boarding and alighting counts can be conducted at the stations. For the parts of bus routes 
that extend beyond the trunk corridor, boarding and alighting counts are generally conducted on board. 
If the buses or minibuses do not stop in consistent locations, the boarding and alighting numbers along 
a link need to be collated and assigned to a reasonable location or segment approximating most boardings 
and alightings, or a location where a new BRT station is being considered could also be used. Boardings 
and alightings are typically known within a segment, but not at an exact location. 

Sometimes boarding and alighting numbers can be collected from Automated Passenger Counter (APC) systems 
if the locale has this technology. APC data can sometimes give very detailed and accurate numbers of 
boarding and alighting customers per bus route, but frequently they are coded by time of day, and the 
station location is not fully clear, so a correlation between APC and existing stops needs to be determined. 


With this data, a map such as the shown in figure 6.2 should be generated: 

\figure{assets/image2.jpeg}{This figure shows in black the proposed BRT corridor in Yichang, China, 
and in green and red the estimated peak-hour boardings and alightings at all the stations on routes that 
are using the BRT trunk corridor. The number of existing boarding and alighting customers at each existing 
station will give a good preliminary indication of which stations are more important than others.}{ 
ITDP.}

This data can already be used to identify some stations that could possibly be eliminated in the new 
BRT service, or stations that might become express stops. In the United States, there has been a tendency 
over the years to accommodate citizens’ demands for adding additional stations to the point where there 
are stations every 200 meters or less. If a stop has very few customers boarding or alighting, extra 
delay is being imposed on all the customers on board the bus to accommodate only a handful of people. 
*The* *BRT Standard* imposes a deduction of 2 points for station stops closer together than 200 meters. 
In some of the high-demand BRT systems in Asia and Latin America, stations are sometimes 200 meters long. 
In addition, this data is used to identify locations where off-board fare collection may be the most 
important.

Further, it is used to identify important transfer nodes. Where large boarding and alighting volumes 
are observed in locations with perpendicular public transport routes and no other clear destinations, 
it is likely that many of the customers are transferring. Identifying these transfer points is important 
to service planning, and additional surveys will need to be conducted at these transfer points as discussed 
in the next subsection. 

\subsection{ Number of Customers Transferring between Routes}

The boarding and alighting data can be used to either construct and/or calibrate a public transport 
trip origin-destination (OD) matrix. This public transport OD matrix reveals where public transport customers 
want to go, regardless of where the current bus or minibus routes go. It can be developed in a number 
of ways depending on the sort of data available. 

For a single corridor, when there is no other data, modelers typically use the same boarding and alighting 
counts done above to first create a “stop-to-stop” OD matrix for routes serving the selected BRT trunk 
corridor. This is generally done by a Fratar distribution model. This mathematical method makes assumptions 
about where people are getting on and off public transport vehicles based on uniform probability. This 
data will generally reliably re-create where customers are starting and stopping their journeys along 
a single public transport route, but it misses where customers may be transferring to other routes. 

In order to transform the stop-to-stop OD matrix into an OD matrix for full trips along the pilot BRT 
corridor, transfer surveys that identify not only the number of people transferring but also their final 
destinations need to be conducted where large volumes of customers board and alight or at locations that 
intersect other public transport routes. All major likely transfer points should be surveyed. Many systems, 
however, have large numbers of transfers distributed across the entire corridor and not necessarily concentrated 
at particular stops, so it is harder to create a full public transport OD matrix from this methodology 
alone. 

\figure{assets/image3.jpeg}{Location of transfer surveys done for Yichang BRT modeling. Image}{ ITDP.}

The transfer survey should interview a statistically significant sample of the boarding and alighting 
customers at each stop and ask them their trip origin, destination, and the public transport route they 
used to make the trip. Once this data is collected, the stop-to-stop OD matrix should be modified based 
on the transfer survey data, to link the appropriate proportion of stop-to-stop trips based on the transfer 
survey results. 

In the developed world, there is usually more data available than can be easily processed. For instance, 
in the United States, a growing number of cities are creating public transport OD matrices from new ticketing 
system information. A growing number of public transport ticketing systems can track by ticket ID number 
where a customer enters the system (where he or she swipes at a payment site). By noting where he or 
she enters the system next, usually in the evening from his or her destination or at some transfer point, 
one can create a matrix of trip origins and destinations for virtually all public transport customers. 
All of this is used to generate a detailed customer “origin and destination matrix.”  

After this is done, there is sufficient data in the demand model to test alternative service plan scenarios. 
If put into a public transport demand model like TransCAD or Emme, more refined alternative service planning 
options can be developed and tested.

\subsection{ Data Processing}

For each existing bus or minibus route along the selected trunk corridor, as stated above, data of 
existing operations needs to be collected for the full length of daily operations. Then, the following 
information can be generated for assisting the service plan: 
\item Total route distance; 
\item Route travel time: total, disaggregated by section and hour of day per section;
\item Stop-by-stop boarding and alighting customers;
\item Vehicle loads at each link (between each station);
\item Overall public transport vehicle and occupancy per section;
\item Overall public transport vehicle frequencies.

From this data, the critical link and load of the corridor can be identified, also known as the maximum 
load on the critical link (MaxLoad). At this location, it is important to have full-day public transport 
vehicle and occupancy counts with consistent data. 

From the full-day counts at the critical link, the degree to which the demand has peaked on the corridor 
can be calculated. This is needed in order to calculate the required fleet under different scenarios 
and to convert peak hour ridership numbers to daily numbers. The total route distance and link-by-link 
peak hour speed are needed to calculate the route-by-route full-circuit total cycle time (TC).

Though not completely necessary at this stage, it will also be useful to know: 
\item The existing fleet size; 
\item The total customers per line per day and per peak hour (to calculate the renovation rate \[$$Ren$$\]);
\item The total vehicle distance operated on the route. 

It will also be necessary to calculate: 
\item The total amount of the route that overlaps the corridor; 
\item The total cycle time that occurs on the planned corridor and off the planned corridor.  

This information gives us the preliminary tools to begin a service planning analysis.

As an example, Figure 6.4 shows a corridor identified as a future BRT corridor in Montgomery County, 
Maryland, USA, to which the involved routes are shown in Figure 6.5. The Table 6.1 presents the total amount 
of the route that overlaps the corridor, and the part of total cycle time that occurs on and off the 
planned corridor.

Figure 6.6 shows travel time differences with the BRT speeds (the pink line) and with the current speeds 
(red line) and the benefit per trip in minutes (the difference between the lines) for the route to be 
incorporated into the BRT corridor in each period of the day. Off-peak benefits will be smaller. The 
potential benefits of implementing each alternative are calculated in table in figure 6.6 for the proposed preliminary 
service plan by multiplying the number of customers for each trip throughout the day by the estimated 
travel time saved.

\endtable

In Table 6.1, which was generated for Montgomery County using the GTFS 
and APC data corresponding to the routes in Figure 6.5, route extension is the percentage of the bus 
route that overlaps with the proposed BRT corridor, and passenger time is the percentage of the customer’s 
time that is the spent on that section of the bus route that overlaps with the proposed BRT corridor. 
While these two indicators essentially measure the same thing, the comparison between the two allows 
for identification of congestion and thus where BRT would significantly improve travel times. If the 
customer time in the corridor (last column marked “passenger time”) is higher than the percentage of 
full bus route length that overlaps with the BRT corridor (second to last column named “route extension”), 
this indicates that the corridor is where most of the congestion is, which suggests BRT should help significantly 
improve travel times.
