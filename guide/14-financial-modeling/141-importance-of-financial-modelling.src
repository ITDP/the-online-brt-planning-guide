The success of advanced transportation systems, such as BRT, does not depend solely on technical resources, 
such as coherent operational planning, technology selection, and transportation infrastructure, 
but also upon financial resources to ensure smooth operation for the entities involved. Through financial modelling, 
it is possible to identify specific issues of the project design, as well as quantify the monetary amounts involved. 
It is based on this information that decision makers may begin searching for financing alternatives and decide on operational scenarios.

Furthermore, financial modelling allows for the appraisal of:

\item Different types of tariff structures;
\item Vehicle fleet compositions;
\item Cost/sizing parameters;
\item Financing options/fees;
\item Profit level/business valuation for the systemâ€™s entities;
\item Free cash-flow and funding-gap analysis;
\item Sensibility analysis.

\subsection{ Importance of Modelling the Financial and Operations Aspects Simultaneously}

Previously, transportation studies and financial appraisals were treated as separate entities, and 
they did not move at the same speed. The problem with this approach is that sound technical plans may 
have been developed, which, once finished, proved to be financially unsustainable and required significant 
changes. Not only would this result in unwanted project development costs for necessary alterations but 
also political costs, due to the postponement of the operational plan and possible tender definitions. 
Additionally, decision makers might have to roll back already made decisions, at an even greater political 
cost, or condemn the city to otherwise avoidable subsidies. 

The correct approach to developing successful transportation plans is to develop the operational plan 
and the financial modelling simultaneously, utilizing the results of one to guide the refinement and 
development of the other. For each scenario, a detailed financial analysis is conducted, which then feeds 
back into the scenario development process.

process that develops the operational plan and financial appraisal simultaneously.}{Logit.}

An added benefit of approaching scenario development in this fashion is that it is possible to generate 
awareness of financial implications as scenarios are being developed. This not only helps steer the scenarios 
toward more sustainable alternatives, but also prepares decision makers for decisions regarding the following 
issues:

\item Subsidy analysis (if subsidies exist, the analysis includes: subsidy amount, one-off subsidy, 
operational subsidy, or subsidy cap limits);
\item Technology choice and vehicle composition (with/without AC, Euro IV/Euro V fleet, type of fuel);
\item Number of system operators (depends on levels of minimum scale);
\item Tariff schemes;
\item Financing options/government guarantees.
