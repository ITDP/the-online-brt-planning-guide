\section{Estimating Demand Using a Full-Transport Model}

\quotation{Those who have knowledge, don’t predict. Those who predict, don’t have knowledge.}
{Lao Tzu, philosopher, 6th century BC}

Most BRT systems in the world have been planned using only a public transport model, without having
the full transportation system modeled. The lack of full modeling occurs because such modeling is only
in its infancy in most developing countries, and it takes time to build up the data, the skills, and
resources to develop a full transport-system demand model. Nonetheless, the tools provided by the full
transport-demand model are very useful to BRT planning, and if time and resources allow, developing a
full transport demand model is worthwhile.

\subsection{Overview}

By including all possible modes and replicating the decision process of all citizens to travel, in
a full-transport model, there will be a much better sense of “potential” customers for the BRT system
who may currently be taking motorcycles, private cars, bicycles, or walking. This model better captures
the effects of congestion on different points of the network.

Guidelines for how to build and operate a full-transport demand model are beyond the scope of this
guide. However, some basic information on transport modeling is included here to give BRT planners a
general overview of how these models work, as they are likely to have output of these sorts of strategic
models. Full transport models are normally constructed upon variations of the “classic four-stage models”
discussed next.

While complex mathematical relationships underpin these full transportation models, the basic premise
behind the modeling analysis can be presented in an understandable form to a wide audience. Figure 4.31
outlines the classic transport model. This model still serves as the basis for the various software products
that today enable effective transport modeling. There are two distinct moments regarding four-stage models:
the model development and the model application. The first is about understanding what factors influence
people’s decisions about what trips they make and how they make them; this is done by observing people’s
decisions and splitting them into groups that made similar decisions when faced with the same parameters.
The second is about proposing new conditions (city growth, transport projects) and simulating the decisions
people make under this new condition.

In short, the application of the model consists of the following:
\item Defining inputs:
\item Land use (existing or future) that points where activities are developed;
\item Transport network (existing or future): road network with its features (eventual bicycle network included here), public transport network (modes, itineraries, frequencies). This changes throughout the day (even road directions can change), so typical moments of the day are to be considered.
\item Calculating the travel matrix (there are usually several “market segment” matrices for each typical moment of the day);
\item Simulating the matrix (demand) with the network (supply) to evaluate how each part of the system will be effectively used.

The third step alone is iterative, because as parts of the system get congested, people will try alternative
paths.

The second and third steps together are also iterative (less iterations are required) as the travel
matrix is a function of the travel times, and congestion will affect the decision to travel.

In the context of planning, the process is iterative, since it is based on the results that one will
propose (or foresee) modifications both in land use and in the transport network.

The four-stage model is useful for the development of a strategic plan, because it makes it possible
to consider new modes of transport to be created and to evaluate long-term land use changes. It is more
useful to use a full transport model when faced with a lack of data from comparable services or services
that do not exist yet, as it will allow for multiple scenarios and an iterative process that looks at
the potential shifts in demand that result from new or additional services.. According to a survey on
fixed-route public transport ridership forecasting and service planning methods appearing in a TCRP,
47 percent of US transport agencies reported using the four-stage model for the purpose of implementing
a new system. The remainder of agencies use different means of estimation, or hire consultants to conduct
a ridership forecast. Of the agencies surveyed, 11 percent use elasticities to determine the impact of
implementing each planned bus rapid transit improvement. Another 11 percent considers the impact of improving
existing travel times. Seventeen percent of agencies would hire an analyst to forecast ridership. The
remaining 19 percent of agencies indicated that they would not analyze ridership impacts, but many were
not currently considering implementing a new mode of public transport service.

The TCRP survey found that 44 percent of agencies used the four-stage model to determine long-term
ridership. Thirty-three percent used trend lines, 22 percent considered service level changes, and 14
percent would not conduct such analysis.

\subsection{Sub-Models}

Market segmentation can be a key issue in deriving good modeling results. Different people react in
different ways to changes in the transport system. Even the same person may behave in different ways
when travelling to work, on business, or during leisure time. These differences affect design when considering
the service during peak (mostly journeys to work and school) and off-peak periods (mostly shopping, social,
and recreational trips). The proper segmentation of data can be costly since it requires more carefully
collected data and greater detail in the modeling process. However, the benefits of segmentation can
be a system well-tailored to the needs of the customers.

\subsubsection{Trip Generation}

When applying this model the *input* is the land use for a given area (zone), which may be expressed,
for example, as:
\item Number of households per income level and per number of residents;
\item Number of residents per age;
\item Level of education;
\item Employment by activity sector.

These are usually projected numbers, based on trending projections considering development projects,
in a table such as Table 4.13.

\figure[large]{assets/image40.png}{Table}{FixMe}

The “borders several OD matrices” are the output of this model; by borders
we mean the total number of trips with origin and destination in each zone, as in the following:

\figure{assets/image41.png}{Table}{FixMe}

For one future scenario, the number of matrices’ borders generated can
easily be over thirty by combining:
\item *Moments of the day:* usually at least morning peak, afternoon peak and off-peak, but sometimes midday and night (this are usually proportionally divided based on traffic and public transport volumes if dynamic allocation will be made);
\item *Trip purpose:* At least work, education, and others, but sometimes this may include: shopping, social, and recreational; health and personal business; and escorting other people;
\item *Income level:* Splitting population into three to five income groups, depending on evidence of behavioral gaps observed in the model development.

Additional classification by person type can be included, typically focusing on personal characteristics
that may include car ownership levels, household size, and household structure along with other factors
such as residential density that play a role in determining the number of trips produced per household.

The development of the model consists in analyzing the mobility rate for trip purpose, including employment
sector and school level for each market segment, normally on data from household and/or workplace surveys.

This analysis is complemented by land use census data (population, employment, education, and specific
activity sectors from commerce, industry, and health agencies and unions) and crossed with current trip
estimates based on traffic and public transport surveys and transportation sector operation reports.

The trip generation model is usually is divided into two other models: *production model* and *attraction
model*.

\subsubsection{Trip Distribution}

The next stage in the application of the model is to fill the interior of the matrices, “the borders”
of which were determined in the previous stage.

This can be seen as a dispute for the places where people will do their daily activities: work, study,
shopping, others. At this point we know where people live and when and what activities they participate
in based on their personal characteristics (income level, at least); we also know where these activities
happen, but not everyone can do them in the same place, and we must assign each person to a location.

This dispute will be based on how people perceive the need to travel as a deterrent to their activities.
In the extreme case of a small town where there is no congestion and the longest possible trip is five
minutes, trips would be proportionally distributed from every origin to every destination. In a larger
city, there will be more trips between closer zones.

Current or future travel times and costs between zones are a function of the existing or proposed transport
network supply for the given time of day (public transport frequencies, road network, etc.) and subject
to congestion, which is a function of the matrix we are trying to determine (one of many matrices we
are trying to    determine). Usually a simulation considering a past distribution or simply the distance
as cost is used as the start of an iterative process; no more than two reiterations are typically required
for reaching a stable solution.

Trips will be distributed with respect to the total cost of travelling from each origin and destination
zone, in an attempt to be proportional to users’ perception of the cost of travelling between the zones.

The perception of cost, including the time to wait and transfer, is discussed in Box 4.2. Those perceptions
are cultural specific and affects the willingness of a given market segment to travel farther and how
they travel. This can be calibrated from the survey data, normally home interviews, as they capture trips
of all possible lengths.

This procedure is commonly referred to as the “Gravity Model,” with its mathematical expression to
satisfy the fulfillment of the matrix in the above condition given by trips between $$i$$ and $$j$$ ($$T_{ij}$$):

Eq. 4.1

$$T_{ij} = A_i \cdot O_i \cdot B_j \cdot D_j \cdot e^{-\beta c_{ij}}$$

Where $$O_i$$ and $$D_j$$ are total trips generated and attracted to zone $$i$$ and $$j$$ respectively, $$c_{ij}$$
is the cost of travelling between $$i$$ and $$j$$ (generally a combination of time and fares) and $$\beta$$ is
a parameter that defines how cost deters travel.
The component $$e^{-\beta c_{ij}}$$ is usually called a deterrence function,
as it expresses the way in which distance (costs) prevents longer trips. As shown in the next figure,
where the Y axis indicates how frequently a given trip would be seen for the travel time given in X:
the lower the beta calibrated for a given market segment, the less the travel time (or travel generalized
cost) is affecting the willingness of that market segment to travel farther to do its activity. The other
two parameters, $$A_i$$ and $$B_j$$ are required to ensure the final trip matrix matches the total number
of trips generated and attracted at each zone; these are estimated iteratively.

\beginbox{Generalized Costs}

The “costs” of using a car or public transport in the transportation models are usually expressed as
“generalized costs” that combine time and money elements. A usual formulation for this generalized cost
is shown below:

\highlight{For public transportation:}

Equation 4.2:

$$C_\text{pub} = a \cdot \text{IVT} + b \cdot \text{WTM} + c \cdot \text{WAT}
		+ d \cdot \text{TTM} + e \cdot \text{NTR} + f \cdot \text{FAR}$$

Where:
\item $$C_\text{pub} =$$ Costs of using public transport;
\item $$a,b,c,d,e\text{ and }f =$$ parameters representing the weight attached to each of these elements in the
journey;
\item $$\text{IVT} =$$ Time in minutes spent on the bus;
\item $$\text{WTM} =$$ Total waiting time to board the bus;
\item $$\text{WAT} =$$ Total walking time to and from the bus stop;
\item $$\text{TTM} =$$ Time spent transferring from one service to another, if any;
\item $$\text{NTR} =$$ Total number of transfers required for the journey, if any;
\item $$\text{FAR} =$$ Total fare paid for the whole journey.

The factors $$a,b,c,d,e\text{ and }f$$ are parameters representing the weight attached to each
of these elements in the journey. This generalized cost can be represented in time or monetary units.
For example, by dividing the whole formulation by $$f$$, the generalized cost would be measured in money
units. It is more advantageous to divide the formulation by $$a$$ and then measure generalized costs in
(in-vehicle) time units.

Research results agree that walking, waiting, and transfer times are between 1.5 and 3 times more onerous
than in-bus times, with the precise values depending on cultural and local conditions like the weather.
Similarly, the need to transfer is perceived by customers as adding a notional three to six minutes to
their journey. A good starting point is to assume that $$b,c\text{ and }d$$ to be twice as big as $$a$$,
and that $$e/a$$ is about five minutes.

This provisional formulation could then be written as (eq. 4.3):

$$C_\text{pub} = \text{IVT} + 2\;\text{WTM} + 2\;\text{WAT} + 2\;\text{TTM}
		+ 5\;\text{NTR} + f/a \cdot \text{FAR}$$

Where:
\item $$f/a =$$ Inverse of the value of time savings.

An initial estimate could be the length of working time required to earn one unit of currency, for
example how many minutes it takes for the average earner to earn US$1. The average earner in question
is the type of user the new BRT is trying to benefit most. For example, if the average wage rate per
hour for the population of interest is US$2, then *α* is thirty minutes per dollar. The generalized
costs in this case would be measures in generalized in-bus minutes.

\highlight{For private transport:}

The formulation would be similar for cars (or motorcycles), but in general it will be assumed that
the waiting time is zero, walking is minimal (usually assumed to be zero as well), there will be no transfers,
and instead of fares one must consider a combination of fuel and parking costs plus any toll payment (eq. 4.4).

$$C_\text{car} = \text{IVT} + g \cdot \text{Fuel} + h \cdot \text{Park}
		+ i \cdot \text{Toll}$$

Where:
\item $$C_\text{car} =$$ Costs of using a car;
\item $$\text{IVT} =$$ Time in minutes spent on the bus;
\item $$\text{Fuel} =$$ Cost of fuel;
\item $$\text{Park} =$$ Cost of parking;
journey;
\item $$\text{Toll} =$$ Cost of tolls;
\item $$g, h\text{ and }i =$$ parameters representing the weight attached to each of these elements in the journey.

This implies that car users are only reasonably aware of fuel costs, but ignore maintenance and depreciation
costs; there is some evidence that this is the case. For parking, the value of $$h$$ is usually assumed
to be half of $$g$$, implying that the parking costs are shared by the onward and return trips. The coefficient
$$i$$ for toll should be the same as $$g$$, except that paying cash for tolls is usually seen as more onerous
than filling up the tank; nevertheless, the default value would be $$i = g$$.

Both expressions for generalized cost (public transport and car) ignore the fact that a car is usually
more comfortable and convenient for many journeys. To accommodate this influence, it is customary to
add a “penalty” to the less convenient mode, in this case public transport. This penalty is in the range
of five to fifteen (generalized) minutes and this extends the generalized cost as (eq. 4.5):

$$C_\text{pub} = \text{IVT} + 2\;\text{WTM} + 2\;\text{WAT} + 2\;\text{TTM}
		+ 5\;\text{NTR} + f/a \cdot \text{FAR} + \text{PENALTY}$$

Where:
\item $$\text{PENALTY} =$$ Cost of public transport being less comfortable and convenient than using a car.

The revised expression for public transport and the expression for private transport are the versions of generalized costs used in Logit mode choice and Gravity models.

\endbox

\subsubsection{Modal Split}

A complexity not previously mentioned is that costs need to consider private and public transport altogether.
When new services are added or taken away, people may shift from one mode to another and some may decide
on the least costly as the car.

In summary, the application of this stage consists in further splitting the previous (eventually fifty
matrices) in two (adding up to a hundred), one for public transport and one for private transport. A
model that includes “Park and Ride” splits the trip into two parts here, including one part in each matrix.

This would entail presenting travellers of a given “market segment” for each OD pair with the times
and costs of several possible modes (under the proposed transport network) to see which mode of travel
they would choose.

Even inside the same “market segment” the changing decision point is not clear—that is, it is not the
same for everyone in that segment. The “answer” of the model is given in proportions, like this: “confronted
with the proposed network costs, people travelling from O to D in the given market segment X percent
will use public transport (eventually specifying which one), Y percent will use private transport (eventually
which one), Z percent will use bicycles.” X, Y, and Z will add up to 100 percent and eventually one (or
more) of them will be zero.

The model development consists of analyzing how people make decisions when confronted with various
alternatives.

From a policy point of view, perhaps the most important stage in the transport-modeling process is
the selection of mode choice for different trips. Determining the number of trips to be made by public
transport, nonmotorized options, and private motorized options will have a profound impact on future
municipal investments. The factors that affect mode choice can be summarized in three groupings :

\number[Characteristics of the trip maker:
\item Car availability and car ownership;
\item Possession of driver’s license;
\item Household structure (young couple, couple with children, retired, single, etc.);
\item Income;
\item Residential density.]
\number[Characteristics of the journey:
\item Trip purpose (work, school, shopping, etc.);
\item Time of day when the journey is taken.]
\number[Characteristics of the transport facility:
\item[Quantitative:
\item Relative travel time (in-vehicle, waiting, and walking times by each mode);
\item Relative monetary costs (fares, fuel, and direct costs);
\item Availability and cost of parking.]
\item[Qualitative:
\item Comfort and convenience;
\item Reliability and regularity;
\item Protection and security.]]

The mode-choice model will typically include these factors in estimating levels of usage between different
modes. Segmentation will of course be very important. One should only include choices that are readily
available to each type of user. For instance, driving a car is only an option for those in households
that own a car. In some cases, travellers with a car provided by their company are in effect captive
to that mode, as they have no choice.

If it has been decided that the BRT design must consider customers attracted from other modes, mode-choice
modeling will be essential. However, this is a specialized undertaking that usually requires good modeling
techniques and trained specialists. If it is not possible to conduct a full modeling process, then it
may be appropriate to make a simplified assumption about potential demand increases due to mode shift.
This shift is unlikely to represent more than 5 to 20 percent of the demand in the new system.

The most common type of model used to represent mode choice is a logit model (and its similar generalization
for multi-class called logit multinomial). The Logit model is a probability distribution for a discrete
choice, where the outcome is related to the characteristics of the user that makes a choice. A higher-income
transport user, then, will have a higher probability of choosing a private car for his or her trip than
a lower income user. This expresses the probability or proportion of trips that would use public transport
($$P_\text{bus}$$) below instead of cars as:

$$P_{bus} = \frac{ e^{-\lambda C_\text{bus}} }{ e^{-\lambda C_\text{bus}} + e^{-\lambda C_\text{car}}}
          = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-\lambda \big( C_\text{car} - C_\text{bus} \big)} }$$

Here, the only new element is the parameter $$\lambda$$. $$C_\text{bus}$$ is the generalized
cost for public transportation and $$C_\text{car}$$ is the generalized cost for a car (this would be calculated for
each OD pair). Figure 4.33 shows the influence of this parameter in making choices very dependent on
(generalized) cost or less so:

\figure[medium]{assets/image44.png}{The influence of $$\lambda$$ on mode choice proportions.}{Luis Willumsen.}

As can be seen, a high value for $$\lambda$$ (0.25) produces a very sharp mode shift for a small difference in
costs; a small value (0.02) produces a gentler transition between modes. Both predict a 50/50 split when
the car and bus costs are equal. The value of this parameter must be estimated locally to represent not
only local behavior but also the size and nature of zones and networks.

\subsubsection{Assignment}

The previous stages in the modeling process focused primarily on the demand side of public transport
services or generating OD matrices. The “assignment” stage is where the supply of public transport services
is matched with these demand conditions in a *simulation*. This is done by calculating the times and
costs required at every path segment of the network, combining it for all the possible paths for all
OD pairs to define which will be taken (in which proportion) for each “market segment” (for that given
moment of the day).

Within a BRT system, the assignment stage also helps identify usage levels among different routing
and service options. For instance, it is quite useful to know the number of customers who will be utilizing
express routes versus local routes.

In order to accurately model public transport route choice, it is necessary to represent the network
with a good degree of realism. Near the corridor, many centroids and centroid connectors should be used
to better represent access times to stations. Moreover, there is always an additional time to reach the
right platform in a BRT or metro system. Transfer times and waiting times for the next available service
should also be represented in the generalized cost of travelling along a particular route. People dislike
transferring services because of the uncertainty involved, so there is usually a transfer penalty to
consider, in addition to the time spent changing services.

Fares should also be accurately represented, and this may prove very tricky in some cases. If there
is no fare integration, each change of service will involve paying a new fare. This additional cost may
be represented as a “boarding charge.” If the fare has an element proportional to distance, this amount
must be added to the journey. For integrated and zonal fares, the issues may be more complex to handle,
but most modern software can cope if skillfully used.

It is important to adopt a realistic assignment model for public transport. This is particularly important
when dealing with corridors where many bus routes converge. If all bus services have similar operating
speeds (a common occurrence on a corridor), earlier models will tend to allocate all trips to the service
with the highest frequency. In reality, people will probably choose the first bus that comes along, and
thus it is probably best to allocate trips to services based on frequency rather than on an “all-or-nothing”
assignment to the highest frequency service. Contemporary software packages, especially those developed
and tested for high public transport usage like Emme/2, Cube/Trips, VISUM, and TRANUS, perform better
in this respect.

Congestion in the system is defined by users’ route choice, and users’ route choice is decided based
on the congestion of the system. Equilibrium conditions within assignment are achieved when each customer
has been assigned the most efficient route considering the congestion of the system. Equilibrium is very
important in dealing with private vehicle assignment, but has an equivalent representation in public
transport. Congestion effects may take place because buses are very crowded and users will experience
losses in time and comfort (increases in generalized costs), similar to driving under congested conditions.
Stopping times increase and customers cannot board a bus (or metro or light-rail vehicle) because it
is full, and they must then wait for the next service. Replicating these conditions is important.

For the purpose of designing a new BRT system, excessive crowding and delays to customers because they
cannot board a bus should be avoided. Therefore, congested public transport assignment should be less
of an issue for design purposes. In any case, congested public transport assignment is tricky and requires
good use of a suitable software platform; it should not be attempted without at least a minimum of assisted
experience.

\subsubsection{Calibration}

Calibration is the process of, after choosing the (sub) model (i.e., defining how input and output
mathematically relate), quantifying (adjust) the parameters that better explain what is observed from
the surveys. Calibration is an activity that happens with the development of the model itself. For example,
in the models discussed in the previous section, calibration is finding such values of $$\beta$$s that promote the best
fit in the distribution model for each “market segment” or the best $$\lambda$$s in the mode selection model.

Usually, when modelers say they are “calibrating the model” they are, in fact, adding detail to the
public transport network (eventually calibrating parameters or creating sub-models to generate congestion),
so that when they run the full model with present conditions, resulting flows reflect what is seen on
the ground (traffic counts and occupancy surveys at that moment of the day). When they calibrate the
matrix models, they usually say they are “making the models.”

\subsubsection{Validation}

Models are developed to represent the reality, based on the isolated observation of several parts in
the travel decision-making process. Each simplification is related to an assumption (i.e., everyone in
a given market-segment behaves the same). Given the complexity of the travel decision-making process,
the simpler the model, the more likely it will not be able to explain and generate details. On the other
hand, the higher the aggregation (less detail), the more reliable (the aggregated) results are.

An additional problem is the fact that, in many cases, we do not know the full extent of the reality
we are trying to model and cannot obtain that data. For instance, we often do not have the real OD matrix,
but the ability to sample the public transport OD is cheaper and is one of the reasons for the reliability
of public-transport-only O/Ds).

Further, the model is constructed to provide answers (in our case the demand on the BRT system, present
and future), the error of the model to forecast answers, and its input requirements and the maintenance
of its assumptions define the validity of the model.

A model that does not provide the required accuracy for business proposals may be valid for corridor
selection (it can certainly point where more benefit will be generated) and valid for feasibility decisions
(it indicates that demand will be above a certain level).

Validation is then a further requirement in which results from the model are compared with data that
has not been used in its construction—for example, a subset of traffic and person counts set aside for
this purpose.

Validation further requires that the responses of the model to changes in some inputs, like prices
or the introduction of new roads and services, are reasonable and consistent with observations and model
results elsewhere.

No model is without errors, but a good calibration and validation process ensures that any significant
error is tackled and eliminated and that the model represents the reality of the base-year situation
in the best possible way.

A common procedure is to adjust the matrices to match the traffic counts and occupancy surveys; such
a procedure, although useful to validate other models for the present, completely undermines the reasoning
of the classic four-stage model and severely limits the validity of the generation, distribution, and
mode selection models.

\subsubsection{Conversion of Demand into Revenue}

The levels of demand estimated by the models will have to be converted via fares into revenues for
the system. This financial modeling will require consideration of the proposed fare system (see Chapter
15: Fare Policy and Structure), the need to share revenue between trunk and feeder services, the existence
of certain discounted fares, such as for students and the elderly, and the fact that there will be levels
of leakage through fare avoidance and collection loses. For that reason, creating a financial model outside
the demand model exercise is needed to understand what the fare should be (see Chapter 14: Financial
Modeling). Once the fare is set, though, the demand model should be tested with that determined cost
to see how it affects the demand.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

The previous modeling stages have combined supply and demand factors to develop an overall simulation
of a city’s public transport services. The final stage of the process is to evaluate the robustness of
the particular solution being proposed by the model. The model (and each sub-model) must be plausible,
i.e., the proposed relations and parameters that relate input (independent variables) and output (results)
make sense (*physical sense* in modeler jargon) by changing the output as expected.

Hopefully, the iterations inside the model and in the planning process will converge into a single,
identifiable solution for the problem (reducing travel time). If several scenarios produce such a convergence,
then the proposed solution is considered to be sufficiently robust. The lack of a convergence may imply
that changes in the model structure are necessary before proceeding.

\subsubsection{Assessment of the Feasibility of the System}

Once some sort of public transport or full transport model has been developed, and a clear scenario
for the BRT system has been defined, it should be possible to make a preliminary assessment of the feasibility
of the system.

As a proxy for cost savings, the value of time savings can be utilized. However, it should be recognized
that time savings is just one of the many reasons for encouraging public transport usage. Other factors
include environmental benefits, fuel cost savings, urban design benefits, and social benefits. A more
complete feasibility cost analysis would thus include these other factors. Further, time savings may
be realized not just by public transport users but by private vehicle users as well.

A good litmus test of whether a new BRT system makes sense is to compare the existing generalized cost
of an array of different trips (origin-destination pairs) as they exist before the BRT system, and what
the cost might be with the new BRT system serving those trips.

It is important to consider this relationship and to sketch out how a new BRT system would reduce the
generalized cost of travel for a set of relevant origin-destination pairs. This calculation can be done
using information already available on existing services, fares, frequencies, and travel times, and compared
to a new system that may have faster travel times on a trunk corridor, but require transfers and perhaps
longer walking times. This would give an idea of how much faster the buses should operate on the trunk
corridor to compensate most travellers for the need to add one or more transfers.

For example, consider the introduction of a trunk-and-feeder system that would replace a number of
direct services. The following estimates should be made to check whether this scenario is going to improve
travel for public transport users. It can be assumed that feeder services will have a similar performance
to the current services, but perhaps a higher frequency for the relevant OD pair. It can also be assumed
that waiting time will be reduced by two minutes each way, and that walking time will remain the same.
The trunk-and-feeder service may require an average of, for example, 1.5 transfers per trip, whereas
beforehand there was no transfer. Each transfer will require additional waiting time for the new service
(say, two minutes each), so the original savings in waiting time will be lost. The trunk road will have
to provide an overall time savings of three times two minutes (six minutes) to be better than the old
system, provided that fares remain the same. Therefore, unless one can provide an average time savings
on the trunk route of five minutes, it will not be worthwhile to introduce a trunk-and-feeder service.
These calculations would have to be repeated for a number of representative journeys to support a decision
one way or another.

The existing public transport system may be used to identify some key corridors where significant elements
of demand will concentrate. Direct observations of the number of buses, with a reasonable estimation
of their customers at peak periods, would enable an initial sizing of the new system. This determination
can be achieved in a short period of time and without detailed information on Origin-Destination patterns.

\subsection{Additional Data Needs}

Much of the data required for the full transport demand model will have already been collected during
the initial analysis period. It is fairly common for transport departments to do traffic counts, and
if recent traffic counts exist in reasonable locations, this data should be usable. If counts for all
vehicles were not done earlier, they need to be done now to calibrate the transport model.

Secondly, when the road network is coded into the transport model, it is no longer enough to simply
identify existing road links, but the definitions of these links (lanes, width, hierarchy class \[ local,
arterial\], regulated speed, etc.) becomes important. Furthermore, all existing alternative modes such
as commuter rail lines, subway lines, bike lanes, and so forth must be coded into the model.

Also, at this point, the demographic and economic activity data for each zone defined earlier becomes
important, such as population by zone, employment by zone, average income by zone, vehicle ownership
by zone, etc. This information is usually obtained from census data. Historical growth rates in population
and employment by zone are the best first indicator of the likely growth rate of future trips in specific
locations. Knowing household incomes and motor vehicle ownership levels will help indicate whether most
people will take the bus, regardless of the price, or whether they will switch to a car or motorcycle.
Mapping the income levels throughout the city will also help define price elasticities and target lower-income
beneficiaries, both important to developing the fare structure. Thus, transport models are usually built
up from demographic data on population, employment, and vehicle ownership.

Finally, for full transport-demand modeling, the planning team will need to conduct a household and/or
workplace origin-destination survey. This survey is necessary since the team will only have estimates
of origins and destinations for public transport trips initially. By contrast, the full-transportation
model will require OD matrices for all modes, including walking trips and private-vehicle trips.

Surveying all members of a household regarding individual travel practices (destinations, mode choice,
reasons for mode choice, travel expenditures, etc.) provides a very complete picture of where people
are going, when, and why.  Likewise, workplace surveys can also be an effective mechanism. Unfortunately,
household and workplace surveys are probably the costliest of the OD survey techniques. As a result,
careful sample sizing is required; knowledge about the variables that will feed the model, their variation,
and how they will affect the model output are paramount to the surveys.

Many cities have been led to waste valuable resources with huge samples, in an attempt to obtain a
detailed OD matrix

Even with very large sampling, it is certain that the resulting matrix will be very sparse; in other
words, most cells will have no trips in them. As a rule of thumb one must have a sample size of 300 to
assure that 95 percent of the surveys made will capture events that happen 1 percent of the time. In
a 200 zone division, very few OD pairs (out of 40,000 possible OD pairs) would concentrate more than
1 percent of the trips and this means already surveying 60,000 trips \[300 hundred for each possible origin
zone\]). The generation and distribution models are often the best method for matrix estimation with a
much smaller sample.

\quotation{The first requirement *\[knowledge about the variables to be estimated for sample size estimation\]*,
although both obvious and fundamental, has been ignored many times in the past. The majority of household
O–D surveys have been designed on the basis of vague objectives, such as ‘to reproduce the travel patterns
in the area’. What is the meaning of this? Is it the elements of the O–D matrix which are required, and
if this is the case, are they required by purpose mode and time of day, or is it just the flow trends
between large zones which are of interest?}
{Ortúzar and Willumsen (2011, 80) are quite incisive on this point.}

A good indication that home base OD surveys are being requested without understanding of the basic
statistical concepts can be found in many government contracts stating that “the sample for each zone
should be enough to guarantee a 5 percent error with 95 percent confidence,” without further stating
in relation to what.

In general terms, if no household survey has already been conducted, one would like to collect at least
some one thousand home interview surveys, and preferably three thousand, in order to produce a rough
four-stage model in the study area. The trip data from these interviews will then be combined with that
from intercept surveys to obtain a more accurate trip pattern in the study area.
