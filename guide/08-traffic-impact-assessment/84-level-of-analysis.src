> The analysis of the thing is not the thing itself.

The impact analysis can be done at various levels of detail. This will depend on the specific needs 
of the planning and design team and on the requirements of the responsible authorities. The level of 
analysis can vary from a course *Planning Level*, to an *Operational Analysis*, and down to a very detailed 
*Microscopic Simulation* level. The purpose of the analysis should be to get a thorough understanding 
of the current traffic volumes and the current operations during all the critical time periods of a typical 
weekday. These will include at least the normal morning and afternoon/evening commuter peaks, but if 
necessary the midday commercial and possible weekend peak hours should also be evaluated. The three levels 
of analysis are not mutually exclusive but can be performed in steps or phases and can be described as 
follows:

\item *Planning and Preliminary Analysis:* The first phase of analysis is normally a Planning Level 
analysis, which should be conducted during the planning phase of the project, but can also be applied 
during the detailed analysis phase of the project. The planning analysis allows for the use of default 
input values instead of using more relevant field-measured values. The results of the planning level 
analysis should be sufficient to clearly indicate which elements of the transportation network are currently, 
or with the future BRT system, at or over capacity and require mitigation, or which elements will be 
operating well below capacity and require no mitigation. Based on the results of the planning analysis, 
the project team and/or the relevant authority can then decide on doing a more detailed operational analysis 
of the network elements where the desired operational outcomes will not be met, i.e., those elements 
where the transport demand will exceed the capacity of the element; 
\item *Operational Analysis**:* Following the planning analysis, the next level of analysis will be 
at an operational level. This is similar to the planning analysis, except the analysis of the critical 
elements is done in more detail, specifically refining the input assumptions, ensuring that the analysis 
is based on field-measured variables such as lane-widths, signal timings, gradients, etc. This level 
of analysis should also include a sensitivity analysis specifically to quantify variation in future operations 
based on the possible variation in input assumptions. For example, the future traffic demand will depend 
on the modal shift from private to public transport, and this could vary depending on the modal shift. 
The results of the operational analysis should, in most cases, provide sufficient detail to satisfy the 
project team and/or the relevant authorities. However, where additional detail is required for complex 
intersections or networks, a Microscopic Simulation will be necessary; 
\item *Microscopic Simulation:* This involves the computer simulation of the behavior and movement 
of individual vehicles, bicycles, and/or pedestrians on the transportation network. At this level, every 
detail of the operations based on the predicted demand and the simulated geometric conditions can be 
assessed. For this analysis to be accurate it needs to include actual field-measured inputs. There are 
several challenges with microsimulation, of which the most important is the validation of the model against 
field data. Without validation of the simulation model, the results should be questioned and interpreted 
with care.
